## Appendix B: Execution Planning Reference

This document (DAiIS Constitutional Framework – Operational Edition v1.2) formally recognizes the **CHATS Artifact Creation Crosscheck v2.2** as the authorized execution planning framework for the DAU Metaverse (DMV) program.

The CHATS framework governs the creation, versioning, and sequencing of foundational planning artifacts required to operationalize the DAiIS charter. Roles defined in this Constitution are responsible for the oversight, quality assurance, and ratification of outputs managed through the CHATS execution matrix.

All procedural artifacts created under CHATS shall align with the governance principles outlined herein. Any future procedural systems or execution models must be version-controlled, reviewed by appropriate DAiIS chartering bodies, and referenced accordingly in both documents.

Conversely, the CHATS document shall include reference to this DAiIS Constitutional Framework as the originating governance authority, ensuring mutual traceability and system integrity.
