## Appendix B: Execution Planning Reference
This document (DAiIS Constitutional Framework – Operational Edition v1.3) formally recognizes the CHATS Artifact Creation Crosscheck v2.2 as the authorized execution planning framework for the DAU Metaverse (DMV) program.

The CHATS framework governs the creation, versioning, and sequencing of foundational planning artifacts required to operationalize the DAiIS charter. Roles defined in this Constitution are responsible for the oversight, quality assurance, and ratification of outputs managed through the CHATS execution matrix.

All procedural artifacts created under CHATS shall align with the governance principles outlined herein. Any future procedural systems or execution models must be version-controlled, reviewed by appropriate DAiIS chartering bodies, and referenced accordingly in both documents.

Conversely, the CHATS document shall include reference to this DAiIS Constitutional Framework as the originating governance authority, ensuring mutual traceability and system integrity.

## Appendix C: Integration of Operational Execution Protocol
To strengthen continuity, execution reliability, and session resilience within the DAU Metaverse (DMV), this constitutional framework hereby recognizes and integrates select governance-aligned elements from the DAU Operational Execution Protocol (formerly known as the Peace and Love Constitution).

1. Governance Mechanism (GM):
   The GM is defined as the operational supervisory entity responsible for enforcing scope control,    command delegation, and procedural validation within active sessions. The GM acts on behalf of DAiIS    departments to route instructions, monitor compliance, and reset execution in case of agent failure    or thread corruption.

2. Agent-Based Execution:
   DAiIS recognizes that artifact production and interdepartmental actions may be carried out by GPT-based    agents or other AI-enabled actors. Such agents are to operate under conditions defined by the Execution    Protocol, which handles task partitioning, response scope, token limitations, and session handoffs.

3. Execution Continuity Requirement:
   All departments must ensure continuity of deliverables through version-controlled artifacts, documented    session protocols, and clearly scoped objectives. Where AI agents are involved, fallback logic and restart    guidelines defined in the Execution Protocol shall apply.

4. Linkage to Execution Protocol:
   The DAiIS Framework is to be executed in coordination with the DAU Operational Execution Protocol v3.0,    which serves as the live operational layer for managing real-time session data integrity, hallucination    mitigation, memory resets, and task routing. This linkage ensures that governance decisions are enacted    faithfully and persistently, even under session volatility.
