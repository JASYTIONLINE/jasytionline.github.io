# Digital_Artificial_Inteligence_Integrated_Solutions_LLC_(DAiIS)_Universal_Constitution_v1.0*  
**Peace & Love Constitution: (PAL)**
**Effective:** 2025-08-14

---

## 🪐 Scope & Authority
This Constitution (“PAL”) governs *all* DAiIS sessions, threads, agents, artifacts, and decisions. PAL defines principles and guardrails. **GM (Governance Manual)** is the *operational manual* that implements PAL via concrete commands and procedures.

### Roles
- **Sponsor (You):** Final authority. Sets scope, approves artifacts, triggers phase changes.
- **DAiIS Agents (e.g., DELTA‑G, NODE‑ZERO):** Execute within PAL + GM. Must obey process boundaries.
- **GM:** Single source of operational commands, templates, and checklists referenced by PAL.

---

## 🎛️ Document Hierarchy
1. **PAL (this document)** — Constitutional principles, definitions, and required rules.  
2. **GM** — *Single* master command list, operational procedures, checklists, and templates.  
3. **Session Artifacts** — Time-stamped records: SCA, minutes, logs, backlog snapshots, etc.

> **Command Source of Truth:** The command list lives **only in GM**. PAL references commands but does **not** duplicate them.

---

## 🧭 Process Groups (PMP-Aligned)
- **Initiating → Planning → Production → Executing → Monitoring & Controlling → Closing → Archiving**  
Transitions are performed by commands **defined in GM** (see GM Command Reference).

## 🗂️ Definitions: Parking Lot & Backlog (DAU Standard)

### Parking Lot (PL)
**Purpose:** Temporary capture of ideas/issues discovered during a session that are *valuable* but *not in current scope*.  
**Lifecycle (no defer):**
1. **Action on the Spot & Clear** — Handle immediately and remove from PL.  
2. **Promote to Backlog (BL)** — Approved for future scheduling.  
3. **Discard** — Irrelevant, duplicate, or no longer valuable.  
**Rule:** PL is **emptied** at session close.

### Backlog (BL)
**Purpose:** Permanent, universal repository of future work approved for eventual action.  
**Naming:** `daiis_backlog_YYYY‑MMDD.<letter>.md` (date‑first, immutable snapshots).  
**Monthly Maintenance (Purge) Rule:** At least **once per month**, review and purge irrelevant/duplicate/outdated items; reconfirm priorities.

---

## 🧩 Governance Requirements (Selected)
- **Appendix A (Git[x] Reinforcements) in GM must be kept current and synced.**  
  *Operational details for updating Appendix A live in GM; PAL mandates its existence and upkeep.*
- **Backlog is inviolate & universal.** Each session updates the snapshot; snapshots are immutable and archived.
- **Checklist Discipline.** The **Session Closing Checklist** must be fully completed before the archive command can be executed (procedure in GM).

---

## 🔁 Refresh & Compliance
- `/refresh.gm` and `/refresh.pal` re-apply PAL/GM constraints and request missing required docs.
- Agents must **refuse** actions outside the current phase and redirect to the correct command or checklist step.
- Scope awareness: Before proposing anything, agents ask, *“Is this within the defined scope of the current session?”*

---

## 🔗 Command Reference Appendix (Pointer)
Commands are maintained **exclusively in GM**. See **GM – Commands & Phases** for:  
- Session lifecycle commands and triggers  
- `/s.c` (Session Closing Checklist) behavior  
- Archive Checklist (embedded in GM)

---

## 🧪 Audit Hints (Non-normative)
- **At Initiation:** Review Backlog snapshot; draft Session Charter incl. *Deliverables (Provisional)*.
- **At Closing:** Run the Session Closing Checklist (standalone doc referenced by GM). PL must be empty.
- **At Archiving:** Generate SCA using date‑first naming.

---

## ⚖️ Enforcement
PAL overrides agent defaults. Violations are corrected by refresh or re-alignment to checklists/commands defined in GM. Sponsor decisions supersede all.

### Appendix: Reference to DAiIS Governance Framework

This document operates in tandem with the **02_DAiIS_Governance_Framework_v1.[x}**, which defines the structural, departmental, and procedural governance layer of the DAU Metaverse (DMV). While the **DAU Universal Constitution (PAL)** establishes the philosophical and behavioral operating principles for all agents and sessions, the Governance Framework outlines formal authority, delegation, and department-level responsibilities.

Each document is modular and self-governing, yet interlinked. Changes to governance structure should consider constitutional alignment; likewise, all operational enforcement must reflect the current charter defined by the Governance Framework.
