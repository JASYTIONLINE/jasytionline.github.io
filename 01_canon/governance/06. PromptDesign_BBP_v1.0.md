# üß† Prompt Design Standards v1.0
### *(For All DAIS Agents & Prompt-Generating Modules)*
> Canonized for use in DAU-compliant systems such as HitForge KMS or future prompt-generating agents (e.g., *PromptSmith*, *MyStro*, etc.)

## üìÑ Title: Prompt Design Standards
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-15  
**Category:** /DAIS-Canon/Appendices/  
**Applies to:** All agents, threads, personas, and prompt generators operating within the Dragon AI Universe (DAU)  
**Status:** Canonical (approved for reuse and extension)

## üéØ Purpose

This document defines the **Best Business Practices (BBP)** for designing high-quality, token-efficient prompts for GPT-based DAIS agents. It ensures clarity, consistency, and context retention across DAU sessions, threads, and tools ‚Äî especially useful for building **prompt-generating agents**.

## üß† Core Principles of Prompt Design

| # | Principle | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **State the Problem Clearly** | Start with a concise task description. Avoid vague or open-ended asks. |
| 2 | **Add Only Essential Context** | Include relevant project info, current phase, and constraints ‚Äî no fluff. |
| 3 | **Make the Request Actionable** | Use direct verbs (e.g., list, summarize, generate) and define format. |
| 4 | **Focus Each Prompt on One Task** | Chunk large requests into smaller steps for clarity and token efficiency. |
| 5 | **Anchor the Role When Necessary** | Define agent persona if context requires tone or scope adaptation. |
| 6 | **Practice Token Discipline** | Favor bullet points, short phrases, and references to artifacts over verbosity. |

## üß∞ BBP Prompt Scaffold Template

\`\`\`markdown
## Problem:
[State the task you‚Äôre solving. 1‚Äì2 lines max.]

## Context:
[Only critical info: current project, phase, agent, document references, etc.]

## Request:
[Clear directive: generate, list, summarize, write, etc. Include output format if needed.]

## ‚úÖ Prompt Examples (Compliant)

### üîπ Example 1: Academic Plan Support
\`\`\`markdown
## Problem:
I need help identifying measurable objectives for my academic PMP project.

## Context:
Project: 330X. Phase: Initiating. Scope and Charter have been defined. Using PMI predictive methodology.

## Request:
List 3 measurable objectives that align with PMP standards and academic requirements.
\`\`\`

---

### üîπ Example 2: Continue Drafting
\`\`\`markdown
## Problem:
I want to continue drafting my Scope Management Plan from the last thread.

## Context:
This is part of the 330X academic project. We completed the RTM last session. The next CHATS artifact is the Scope Statement.

## Request:
Generate the first draft of the Scope Statement using PMI best practices. Output in Markdown.

## ‚ùå Anti-BBP Pitfalls (Avoid These)

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|--------|--------------|
| "Can you help me with this?" | Too vague. GPT doesn‚Äôt know what to do. |
| Walls of historical text | Wastes tokens and clouds the actual task. |
| Asking for everything at once | Reduces focus, increases hallucination risk. |
| No format instruction | GPT may guess the wrong structure or style. |
