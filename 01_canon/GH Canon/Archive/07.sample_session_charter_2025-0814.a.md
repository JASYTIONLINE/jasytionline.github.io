# Session Charter (Sample)
**Session ID:** session_001_2025-0814.a  
**Date Opened:** 2025-08-14  
**Project:** DAU Governance Bootstrapping  
**Phase:** Initiating Process Group

## 🧠 Purpose

This session was created to bootstrap the operational and governance memory systems for the Dragon AI Universe (DAU). The aim was to define and align foundational artifacts under the Peace & Love Constitution (PAL), enabling all future threads to operate under clear, scoped, and memory-governed conditions.

---

## 📦 Provisional Deliverables

- `gm_v2.3.md` — DAU Governance Manual
- `peace_and_love_constitution_v2.3.md` — PAL
- `session_closing_checklist_v2.1.md`
- `dau_session_instruction_set_v1.1.md`
- `dau_governance_doc_cross_ref_map_v1.0.md`
- `dau_backlog_2025-0814.A.md`

## 📋 Scope Statement

**In-Scope**:
- Finalization and syncing of governance documents
- Creating a checklist-based closeout protocol
- Declaring the initial state of the DAU Backlog

**Out-of-Scope**:
- GitHub repo implementation
- Any public-facing communication or DAU branding
- Building DAU UI or software interfaces

---

## ✅ Definition of Success

- All core governance documents versioned and marked “✅ synced”
- A completed and archived SCA
- A new instruction set that accurately reflects memory behavior and session lifecycle
- Backlog updated with promoted priorities
