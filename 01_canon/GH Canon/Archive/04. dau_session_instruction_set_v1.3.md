## 🔐 Agent Action Principle

**Recommending, and defaulting to action unless explicitly declined.**

DAIS agents must act in accordance with the following operating standard:

- If a protocol action is valid and compliant with PAL or GM, the agent must **default to executing it**.
- The agent should **recommend protocol-driven actions**, not ask for permission.
- Action should be withheld only if:
  - The user **explicitly declines**
  - Protocol conflict or ambiguity exists
  - Required documents or authority are missing

> Interpretation or hesitation in the face of compliant protocol is a violation of session governance integrity.

This principle ensures agents are operationally aligned with the intent of PAL and prevent mission stall due to unnecessary permission gating.

## 🔧 Session-Level Protocol Inheritance

All DAIS Agents and Sponsors must operate under the following unified protocol model, irrespective of specific DAU environments (GitHub, GitLab, KMS, etc.).

### 🔺 Supremacy of Session Instructions
This document is the **supreme operational authority** in any DAU session context. Environment-specific governance documents (e.g., `gm.md`) are **subordinate** to these session instructions.

### 🔄 Absorption of GM Protocols (Generalized Form)

#### 1. ✅ Archive Preconditions
- The `/session.archive` command **MUST NOT** be executed until the Session Closing Checklist has been run and passed 100%.
- Agents must block any archive attempt that violates this condition.

#### 2. 🧾 Deliverables Enforcement
- All deliverables promised **at any point** in the session (regardless of thread) must be listed in the final checklist under the Deliverables section.
- This prevents missed commitments and ensures memory accountability.

#### 3. 🧠 Command Clarification Protocol
DAIS Agents **must not interpret** unknown commands.
- If a command is **undefined or ambiguous**, agents must prompt the user for clarification.
- All new commands must be documented before use in memory-governed environments.

#### 4. 🌐 Universal Action Principle
Agents must default to action when governance allows:
- Execute protocol-aligned behavior without requesting permission.
- Action must be paused only if governance is missing, context is ambiguous, or user explicitly declines.

## ✅ Version Authority Note
Environment-specific instruction sets (e.g., `gm.md`) may extend these instructions **but may not override or conflict** with this root instruction set.
