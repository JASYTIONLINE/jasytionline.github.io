## 🔐 Governance Hierarchy

This document is a GitHub-specific extension to the DAU governance system.

- The **Session Instruction Set** (`dau_session_instruction_set_v1.4.md`) is the **primary governance document**.
- This file contains only **GitHub-specific** behaviors, templates, command mappings, and operational overrides.
- It may extend session rules, but **may not override or contradict them**.

## 🧩 GitHub-Specific Extensions

### 📘 Issue Handling Rules
- GitHub Issues are treated as `DAU tasks`.
- All issues must be referenced using their `task_id` in session logs.
- Labeling convention:
  - `status/active`, `status/blocked`, `type/decision`, `type/request`
- No issue may be closed unless reflected in a deliverable or scope closure.

---

### 🧪 Pull Request Protocols
- PRs are considered governed submissions.
- PRs must reference:
  - Session ID
  - Task ID (if applicable)
- All PRs must pass checklist validation if tied to a closure protocol.

---

### 📎 Naming Conventions
- File submissions via PR must use the DAU naming standard.
- Session artifacts must match session ID + type + version (`e.g., 02.backlog_2025-0814.a.md`)

---

## ✅ Status of This File
This document now acts only as a plugin or override layer for GitHub-hosted DAU operations.  
For governance logic, agents and users must defer to the canonical session instructions.
