## Session Closing Checklist
The Session Closing Checklist is stored as a standalone dated file (example: `session_closing_checklist_2025-0814.md`).  
It is used during the Closing Process Group to verify readiness before running `/session.archive`.

**Short Archive Checklist** remains embedded in this GM and runs only after you confirm “Ready to Archive.”
