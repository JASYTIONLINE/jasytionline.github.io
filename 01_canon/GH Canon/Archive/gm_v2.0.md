# Git Memory (GM) v2.0 — Dragon AI Universe (DAU)

## Purpose
The GM is the operational manual for DAU sessions. It contains:
- Full command list (master source, referenced by PAL)
- All procedures for session phases (Initiating → Planning → Executing → Monitor & Control → Closing → Archive)
- Governance rules for operational integrity
- Appendices for reference

---
## Updates in v2.0

### 1. Appendix A Reference & Sync Procedure
- **Rule:** Appendix A must be maintained in GM and synced with PAL governance requirements.
- GM is the **master source** for operational details. PAL only references Appendix A.

### 2. Session Charter Template Update
**Deliverables (Provisional)** section is mandatory at initiation.
- This list is drafted in the Session Charter during the Initiating Process Group.
- It is updated during Planning and finalized in Closing.

### 3. Archive Trigger Rule
- `/session.archive` **cannot** be executed unless the Session Closing Checklist has been run to completion with 100% checks passed.
- This is a hard stop rule; archive commands before checklist completion are invalid.
