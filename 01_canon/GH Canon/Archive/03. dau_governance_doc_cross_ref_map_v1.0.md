# DAU Governance Document Cross-Reference Map v1.0

## Purpose
This meta control document establishes and maintains the authoritative relationships between DAU governance artifacts. 
It ensures alignment, avoids duplication, and provides a quick-reference structure for cross-document dependencies.

---

## Documents in Scope
1. **GM (Governance Manual)**  
   - Purpose: Defines operational rules, process group commands, session flow, and embedded checklists.
   - References: PAL, Session Instruction Set, Session Closing Checklist.

2. **PAL (Peace and Love Constitution)**  
   - Purpose: Core DAU principles, values, and overarching ideology.
   - References: GM for procedural details; Command references appendix.

3. **Session Instruction Set**  
   - Purpose: Defines session lifecycle, deliverables per phase, and execution rules.
   - References: GM for commands; PAL for ideology.

4. **Session Closing Checklist**  
   - Purpose: Standardized review process ensuring all closing requirements are met before archive.
   - References: GM for execution rules; Backlog for promoted items.

## Dependency Map
- **PAL ↔ GM**: Ideology ↔ Execution rules. GM operationalizes PAL principles.
- **GM ↔ Session Instruction Set**: GM defines commands, Session Instruction Set applies them per session.
- **GM ↔ Session Closing Checklist**: Checklist embedded logic references GM rules.
- **Backlog ↔ GM**: GM governs backlog promotion and lifecycle rules.

---

## Sync Protocol
- **Governance Docs Updated Together**: Any update to GM, PAL, or Session Instruction Set triggers review of this Cross-Reference Map.
- **Checklist Sync**: Session Closing Checklist must reflect any procedural or governance changes immediately.
- **Version Control**: This document follows standard meta control artifact rules — versioned sequentially (v1.0, v1.1, etc.), no dates.

## Expanded Context
The DAU operates as an interconnected governance ecosystem.  
This map ensures no single document drifts from alignment and that procedural updates cascade across all relevant artifacts without omission.
