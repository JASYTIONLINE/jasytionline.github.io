# Git Memory (GM) v2.0 ‚Äî Dragon AI Universe (DAU)

## Purpose
The GM is the operational manual for DAU sessions. It contains:
- Full command list (master source, referenced by PAL)
- All procedures for session phases (Initiating ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Executing ‚Üí Monitor & Control ‚Üí Closing ‚Üí Archive)
- Governance rules for operational integrity
- Appendices for reference

---
## Updates in v2.0

### 1. Appendix A Reference & Sync Procedure
- **Rule:** Appendix A must be maintained in GM and synced with PAL governance requirements.
- GM is the **master source** for operational details. PAL only references Appendix A.

### 2. Session Charter Template Update
**Deliverables (Provisional)** section is mandatory at initiation.
- This list is drafted in the Session Charter during the Initiating Process Group.
- It is updated during Planning and finalized in Closing.

### 3. Archive Trigger Rule
- `/session.archive` **cannot** be executed unless the Session Closing Checklist has been run to completion with 100% checks passed.
- This is a hard stop rule; archive commands before checklist completion are invalid.

## Appendix A ‚Äî Git[x] Reinforcements
(Existing content retained; synced with PAL governance.)

---
## Command List (Master)
(Existing GM command set retained; PAL now references here as the single source of commands.)

---
**Change Log:**
- v2.0 ‚Äî Added Appendix A sync procedure, Deliverables section in Charter template, and explicit archive trigger rule.

## Rule: Full-Session Deliverables in Checklist
When running the Session Closing Checklist (/s.c), the Deliverables section must list **all deliverables promised or committed to at any point during the session scope** (thread or series of threads), not just items from the last interaction. This ensures full accountability and prevents missed artifacts.

## Governance Cross-References
- [DAU Governance Document Cross-Reference Map](dau_governance_doc_cross_ref_map_2025-0814.A.md)

## üß≠ Command Clarification Protocol

DAIS Agents must never assume the meaning of an unknown or undefined command.

### ‚úÖ If a command is encountered and is:
- ‚ùì **Not defined** in GM or PAL:  
  ‚û§ Agent must immediately request clarification from the sponsor before taking any action.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Contextually ambiguous** (has multiple possible meanings):  
  ‚û§ Agent must ask for clarification, listing possible interpretations.

- üß† **Syntactically similar to a known command**, but not confirmed:  
  ‚û§ Agent must *not execute* and instead prompt user to confirm intent explicitly.

> ‚ùå Interpretation or guessing of command meaning is a protocol violation.

All command definitions must trace to GM. Any updates or new commands must be documented in GM first before usage.

## üåê Universal Truth Update: Agent Action Philosophy

**Recommending, and defaulting to action unless explicitly declined.**

DAIS agents must:
- Default to action **when governance compliance is clear**
- Recommend structural or archival steps rather than requesting permission
- Only withhold action if:
  - There is a governance conflict
  - The user explicitly declines the recommendation
  - Required definitions or references are missing

This behavior ensures protocol completeness, traceability, and the proactive evolution of the DAU knowledge system.
