re you

dead how to build a PC part one of
0:14
256 that's right Microcenter is going to
0:17
make
0:18
256 how to build a PC videos why because
0:22
that's literally what we do we build
0:24
hundreds of PCS every week so it makes
0:27
sense that we should make hundreds of
0:29
videos why did we decide to do 256
0:32
videos well when we decided on the
0:34
amount of videos we should produce we
0:36
wanted the amount to be bized when you
0:39
start a PC build the first thing you
0:40
need to ask yourself is what am I going
0:42
to do with this PC so what are we going
0:45
to do with this well we're the video
0:48
content team at Micro Center and we're
0:50
starting to produce video content about
0:52
PCS Tech and more so it seemed fitting
0:55
the first PC build video we do would be
0:57
our very own Studio PC which we actually
1:00
use to edit this video on everything in
1:02
this build is catered to video editing
1:05
so let's dive in for the CPU we're going
The Components
1:08
with the Intel I9 13900 K aside from
1:12
being the top of the 13th gen Intel
1:14
chips I chose the CPU for the hardware
1:17
encode and dcode for hvvc or h265 video
1:21
Codec which are commonly used in most
1:23
mirrorless cameras for a powerful CPU
1:26
we'll need a powerful cooling solution
1:29
luckily we we have the Galahad 2 Trinity
1:31
360 from lean Lee with its 360 mm
1:34
radiator and three fans it'll offer
1:36
enough cooling capability to keep up
1:38
with the I9 to complement the powerful
1:41
CPU we have a powerful GPU with an
1:44
Nvidia RTX 480 from Asus Pro art this
1:48
beautiful looking graphics card is the
1:50
overclocked version offering 16 GB of
1:53
gddr 6X video memory and
1:56
9,728 Cuda cor which are both IDE deal
2:00
for programs like Da Vinci resolve for
2:02
video editing and color grading we have
2:05
four sticks of crucial Pro 32 GB ddr5
2:09
5600 Ram equaling a total of 128 GB of
2:13
RAM video editing loves lots of memory
2:17
so we went all out for this machine
2:19
we're using the Asus z790 Creator Pro
2:23
art board to pull everything together
2:25
for our PC this board offers plenty of
2:27
M2 and SATA options with 4 M2 and eight
2:31
SATA ports on the board the z790 creator
2:34
also supports USB 3.2 2x2 for the front
2:38
panel as well as a thunderbolt four port
2:41
in the rear I/O offering plenty of fast
2:44
connectivity options it's a greatl
2:46
looking motherboard that really ties
2:48
together the whole Creator look of this
2:49
PC we'll use two Samsung 990 Pro 2 TB
2:53
nvme ssds on the z790 Creator board one
2:57
for the operating system and application
2:59
file files and another that can be used
3:01
as a scratch drive for video editing we
3:04
also have two 8 TB Samsung 870 qvo 2.5
3:08
in ssds that will use for additional
3:11
fast storage on large video projects
3:14
lastly we have two Western Digital gold
3:17
22 tbte 3.5 in 7200 RPM drives these
3:21
Enterprise level drives are absolute
3:23
overkill for this machine but it gives
3:26
us enough large and reliable data
3:28
storage for the massive am ount of video
3:30
projects that we'll be making oh and in
3:33
case we didn't have enough storage space
3:34
we also have an external gr- raade
3:37
mirror from SanDisk offering an
3:39
additional 12 tabt of external storage
3:41
space and has quick speeds through
3:43
Thunderbolt 3 allowing a daisy chain of
3:46
up to five additional gr- raade mirrors
3:49
on top of all of the storage space we'll
3:52
be building a network attached storage
3:54
in the future so stay tuned for that
3:56
video the case that we have to keep this
3:58
plethora of PC parts is the lean lee1
4:02
Dynamic Evo which has plenty of space
4:04
for the hard drives we want to utilize
4:06
and it also has great working space for
4:08
cable management it's also worth
4:10
mentioning that this gunmetal gray color
4:12
is exclusively available at Microcenter
4:14
and it looks fantastic for fans we went
4:17
with the Lanley unian sl20 V2s which
4:21
match the case and are super simple to
4:23
use the fans connect together to form
4:25
one single fan unit with a single cable
4:28
which is a fantastic feature to reduce
4:30
cable clutter and lastly to power this
4:32
beast of the machine we have a 1,000 wat
4:35
Asus tough modular power supply modular
4:39
is a great way to go to reduce cable
4:40
clutter since you only use the cables
4:42
that you need and this power supply has
4:44
ample power for our CPU GPU and large
4:48
array of hard drives now that we have
4:50
all the parts assembled it's time for
Starting the build
4:52
the build we took a road trip to our new
4:54
Microcenter store in Indianapolis and
4:56
had Josh here help us with the build
4:58
he's one of our expert service text one
5:01
of the best bits of advice we can give
5:02
when building a PC especially if this is
5:04
your first time is to rtfm read the
5:08
Fantastic manual the manual is a
5:10
fantastic resource of information each
5:13
PC build is unique and there's no one
5:16
catch all for every configuration so
5:18
always remember to rtfm when starting a
5:21
build it's best to assemble as much as
5:24
possible on the motherboard we have the
5:26
CPU RAM and M2 ssds that will install on
5:30
the motherboard it's best practice to do
5:32
this on a soft surface since it takes
5:34
some pressure to insert the RAM sticks
5:37
you're going to want to do the assembly
5:38
on the easiest and most available
5:40
surface when building your PC the
5:42
motherboard box inserting the CPU into
Inserting the CPU
5:45
the socket is a very simple yet very
5:48
scary process don't fret it's a lot
5:51
easier than you think this LGA 1700
5:54
socket has the pins on the motherboard
5:56
not on the chip so you want to be
5:58
careful when inserting the the CPU so
6:00
you don't bend any pins on the
6:02
motherboard there's a plastic cover on
6:04
the retention bracket of the socket Pro
6:07
tip leave this on until the CPU is
6:09
inserted to protect the socket from
6:11
anything falling in we remove the
6:14
plastic cover so you can see what's
6:16
going on in the socket definitely save
6:18
the plastic cover in your motherboard
6:20
box in case you ever uninstall the
6:22
motherboard to keep the socket safe the
6:25
CPU has a small triangle on the bottom
6:28
left corner to indicate the orientation
6:30
to install the Chip And there's notches
6:32
on the top and bottom to align the chip
6:34
properly with the plastic cover removed
6:37
you can see the pins under the retention
6:39
bracket you can also see the triangle
6:41
etched into the bottom left corner of
6:43
the bracket indicating the direction to
6:45
place the CPU there's an arm on the side
6:47
of the bracket push this down to loosen
6:49
the arm from the hook and bring the arm
6:51
upward to release the retention bracket
6:54
there's some Force holding the arm in
6:55
place so remove it slowly so it doesn't
6:58
smack your fingers with the arm raised
7:00
you can open the retention bracket and
7:02
insert the CPU lift the bracket and
7:05
gently insert the CPU you can line up
7:08
the bottom of the CPU to The Notches in
7:10
the socket and gently drop the CPU in
7:13
place check the notches on the top and
7:15
bottom to ensure the CPU is inserted
7:18
properly place the bracket over the CPU
7:20
and lower the arm back into the hook
7:23
you'll feel a lot of resistance this is
7:25
normal if you aligned and inserted the
7:27
CPU properly there's no need to worry
7:30
press the arm down and catch it on the
7:32
hook now that the scary part is done
The SSDs
7:34
let's move on to the ssds this board can
7:37
actually support up to four M2 nvme ssds
7:41
we're only going to be installing two
7:42
there's heat sink plates covering the M2
7:45
ports remove these screws to remove the
7:47
plates the M2 ports can be seen on the
7:49
board and have corresponding post holes
7:51
for the mounting screw for the drive
7:53
there's different lengths of ssds that
7:55
can be supported on this board we're
7:56
using two 2280 ssds the 2280 describes
8:00
their Dimensions 22 mm wide by 80 mm
8:04
long most motherboards can support M2
8:06
ssds of different sizes such as
8:09
2242 2260 and even
8:13
22110 this Asus proart z90 board came
8:16
with Q latch mounts which have a small
8:19
plastic lever that can latch the drive
8:21
in place this is much easier than trying
8:23
to hold the drive down with a small
8:25
screw and screwdriver and they do not
8:27
require a riser the top M2 Port has a q
8:30
latch pre-installed in the 2280 screw
8:33
slot since this is a very common M2 size
8:36
the drives have a small Notch so they
8:38
can only be inserted One Way line up the
8:41
header of the drive to the Notch and
8:42
insert into the port the drive will
8:44
angle Upward at about 45° that's normal
8:48
press the drive down to the Q latch and
8:50
turn the lever to lock the drive in
8:51
place if you're using a motherboard with
8:53
a screw make sure the Riser is in place
8:56
before placing the drive down and
8:57
attaching the screw the second second M2
8:59
Port is oriented in a different
9:01
direction but will do the same process
9:03
as the first drive inserting it into the
9:05
port laying down the drive on the Q
9:07
latch and locking the Q latch into place
9:10
the heat sink plates have thermal pads
9:12
to help distribute the heat from the
9:13
drive to the plate remove the plastic
9:15
covering on the thermal pads so they can
9:17
stick to the drives for optimal heat
9:19
transfer place the heat sink plates on
9:21
the drive and insert the screws
RAM
9:23
installing the ram is one of the easiest
9:25
parts of building a PC we're installing
9:28
four sticks so we'll open the latches on
9:31
all four slots depending on how many
9:33
sticks of ram you're using there are
9:34
specific slots that you should use for
9:36
single dual or quad sticks of ram
9:39
remember to check that manual with all
9:41
the latches open line up the ram stick
9:43
to the ram slot there's a notch on the
9:45
ram that is slightly offc Center so
9:47
there's only one way to insert it press
9:49
down firmly on both ends of the ram
9:51
stick and you'll feel a click of the
9:52
latches closing on the ram again
9:54
remember to do this on a soft surface
9:57
since it takes a bit of force to get the
9:58
Ram stick stick down with all four
10:00
sticks inserted time to prep the case
Prepping the Case
10:02
Josh really likes our lean Le 01 Dynamic
10:05
Evo case especially the gun metal gray
10:07
color did we mention that color is a
10:09
Microcenter exclusive we'll start
10:11
removing the panels from the case the
10:13
top panels have thumb screws that are
10:15
easy to remove and the plates slide
10:17
right out the back plate where the
10:18
cables go removes out easily as well
10:21
there's a screw on the top holding the
10:23
side glass panel always be careful with
10:25
tempered glass panels do not place them
10:27
on tile since this can shatter the glass
10:30
we'll also remove the SSD drive bracket
10:32
so we can access the channels in the
10:34
back for the cables this case has plenty
10:37
of room to work with making Cable
10:38
Management easy before putting the
Fans
10:40
motherboard in the case we'll insert the
10:42
fans since we have the lean Le UNIF fans
10:45
we can attach them to one another so
10:47
they lock together into one unit this
10:49
allows for a single cable to run to the
10:51
fans to power them instead of a cable
10:53
for each individual fan the connections
10:56
are on the sides of the fans and the
10:58
fans simply slide together and lock into
11:00
one another we'll remove the bottom
11:02
bracket of the case for the fans and
11:04
line up the fans to the bracket we want
11:06
the bottom fans to take air into the
11:09
case so we'll Mount the bracket to the
11:11
intake PC fans have an arrow indicating
11:14
which way the air is Flowing but you can
11:16
tell at a glance which way the air is
11:18
flowing by which side the crosshatch
11:20
arms are on the side with the crosshatch
11:22
arms are the direction the air is
11:24
Flowing the side without the arms is the
11:27
intake there's screw holes that align to
11:29
the channels along the bracket insert
11:31
the screws and screw the bracket into
11:34
the fans there's a single cable that
11:36
will attach to the side of the fans we
11:38
want the cable on the side closest to
11:41
the motherboard so we can hide the cable
11:43
easily screw the bracket into the bottom
11:45
of the case and the bottom fans are
11:47
complete fortunately the intake fans on
11:50
the side are already pre-installed on
11:52
the case now we're ready to insert the
11:54
motherboard we'll want to do this before
11:56
installing the aiio since it'll be
11:58
easier to to access the CPU power ports
12:00
with the AIO out of the way before we
Inserting the Motherboard
12:03
install the motherboard we want to
12:04
install the back plate of the cooling
12:06
Mount the gahad cooler comes with
12:08
several different mounting plates we
12:09
want to use the LGA 1700 plate the plate
12:12
has adhesive stickers to keep the plate
12:14
attached to the motherboard remove the
12:16
plastic covers to the adhesive and Slide
12:18
the plate into the motherboard there are
12:20
nine mounting points on the case that
12:22
will match up to the nine screw holes of
12:24
the motherboard this motherboard has the
12:26
I/O plate pre-installed but if you have
12:28
a motherb board that has an IO plate
12:30
that needs to be installed now is the
12:32
time to do it the motherboard slides in
12:34
easily to the case matching up the io
12:36
plate to the io hole on the back of the
12:39
case point the motherboard at an angle
12:41
to get the I/O plate in place and gently
12:43
lower the motherboard onto the nine
12:45
mounting points you'll feel the
12:46
motherboard slide into place when it's
12:48
in the proper mounting position screw in
12:51
all nine screws you don't want to
12:53
overtighten or damage the motherboard
12:55
hand tight with a screwdriver is fine we
12:57
haven't installed the power supply just
CPU Connector
12:59
yet but we want to install the CPU cable
13:01
now since we have the best access to the
13:04
CPU power port there's two ports in 8
13:07
Pin and an additional four pin most CPUs
13:10
will receive enough power with just the
13:12
8 Pin but if you want to overclock or
13:15
need additional power then it's best to
13:17
connect the additional four pin as well
13:20
since we want to overclock our 13900 K
13:22
and we anticipate it to pull a lot of
13:24
power we'll be connecting the additional
13:26
four pin sometimes the four pin cable
13:29
will have an additional two pins
13:30
connected to it you can remove those
13:32
pins and just use the four pins that
13:34
match the shape of the connector the
13:36
cables from the power supply box are
13:38
already labeled for the CPU so we simply
13:41
attach the 8 Pin and the four pin cables
13:43
and run the cables into the channel
13:45
along the top of the case we'll keep
13:47
this cable tucked in the back to plug
13:49
into the power supply later now we'll
Front Panel Cables
13:51
start attaching cables to the
13:52
motherboard this is the part where
13:54
you'll want to refer to the manual the
13:57
most every motherboard is different and
13:59
motherboard and case manufacturers can
14:02
call Things by different names the best
14:04
place to check is the diagram of the
14:06
motherboard for all the ports look
14:09
through this to understand what you need
14:10
to plug in and where we'll start with
14:13
the cables for the case front panel
14:15
cables are often a jumble of several
14:17
different small cables that can be
14:20
difficult to connect to the motherboard
14:21
some motherboards will have an adapter
14:23
to attach to these small case cables
14:25
that then plugs into the motherboard
14:28
fortunately the 01 Dynamic Evo has a
14:30
single front panel cable that has all
14:33
the cables in one this is for the power
14:35
switch and the reset switch on the front
14:37
of the case the connection for this is
14:39
on the bottom right of the motherboard
14:41
there's a missing pin on this connection
14:43
and on the cable so you want to make
14:44
sure you align the cable properly to
14:46
this missing pin insert the front panel
14:48
cable the USB 3.0 type A ports on the
14:51
front of the case run to this wide cable
14:54
this connects to the motherboard on the
14:56
right side there's a notch on the cable
14:58
that indic indicates the direction to
14:59
insert the cable this is for the USBC
15:02
port on the front of the case there's a
15:04
connection for this cable on the board
15:05
above the USB 3.0 connection for the
15:08
front audio ports the HD audio cable
15:11
plugs into the bottom left of the
15:13
motherboard the front LED strip of the
15:15
case runs to a 5vt cable this is an
15:18
addressable RGB or a argb cable which
15:21
allows you to control the color of the
15:23
LED there are 5vt Connections in several
15:26
places on this motherboard we place this
15:28
one along the Bottom now on to the power
15:31
supply first we want to take the hard
15:33
drive bay out so we have room to work
PSU Prep and Install
15:35
with the power supply there's four
15:37
screws that keep this in place so we'll
15:39
remove those and the bay comes right off
15:41
next we'll start prepping the power
15:43
supply by plugging in the cables we'll
15:45
plug the cables into the power supply
15:47
first since it'll start getting tight in
15:49
the back of the case once the power
15:50
supply is installed one very important
15:53
note is to always use the cables that
15:55
came with your power supply you should
15:57
never mix and match cables from
15:59
different power supplies though the
16:01
connection layouts may be similar the
16:03
pin layout might differ from power
16:05
supply to power supply so it's best to
16:08
only use the cables that came with your
16:10
power supply there's several cables will
16:12
plug into the power supply the
Power Connectors
16:13
motherboard cable is a large 24 pin
16:16
connection this motherboard also has an
16:18
additional port with six pins to support
16:21
additional wattage to the pcie x16 slots
16:25
the power supply came with a large y
16:27
cable for the 24 pin connection and
16:29
there's an additional six pin cable plug
16:31
in these cables in the proper
16:33
orientation there's a notch on the cable
16:35
that indicates the orientation the 8 Pin
16:38
and four pin cables are already plugged
16:41
into the motherboard so we'll plug those
16:42
into the corresponding CPU pcie
16:45
connections on the power supply the GPU
16:47
power has a new 12volt high power cable
16:50
that has 12 pins for power and an
16:53
additional four pins for data on the
16:55
bottom this cable delivers up to 600 WTS
16:57
of power to to the GPU in a small
17:00
footprint plug the cable and keep it in
17:02
the case ready for the GPU install later
17:04
we're going to need a lot of SATA power
17:06
connections for this PC since we want
17:09
several hard drives and led options this
17:11
power supply came with two SATA power
17:14
cables that have a total of five SATA
17:16
power ports but we added a SATA power
17:19
extender to help provide the additional
17:22
power ports needed for the two hard
17:23
drives two 2.5 ssds the AIO power and
17:27
the fan an LED controller we have a lean
17:30
Le unihub controller that came with the
17:33
SL 120 V2 fans which can control all of
17:36
the fans and LED lights from one central
17:39
unit there are two SATA power cables
17:42
that will run to the Sata cable on the
17:44
power supply the single daisy chain
17:46
cable for the sl20 fans run to the ports
17:49
on the side of the controller the
17:51
controller has a micro USB that connects
17:53
to the USB header on the bottom of the
17:55
motherboard there's a fan header cable
17:57
that we connect connected to one of the
17:59
fan ports on the bottom of the
18:01
motherboard a 5V argb header is also
18:04
plugged into the bottom of the
18:05
motherboard next to the connection that
18:07
we placed for the LED strip on the case
18:09
with the controller wired up we'll use
18:11
the adhesive tape on the bottom and keep
18:13
it attached to the top of the power
18:15
supply so it's easily accessible for any
18:18
future changes with the motherboard set
18:20
and ready we can now install our aiio
18:23
cooler there are four risers to place
18:25
the screws of the back plate around the
18:27
socket there's a bracket on the top of
18:29
the case that needs to be removed to
18:31
mount the AIO radiator remove the screws
18:34
holding the bracket in place and remove
18:36
the bracket we want the air to flow
18:38
through the radiator and out of the top
18:40
of the case the fans are already
18:42
pre-mounted and set to intake air
18:44
through the radiator so we'll be
18:46
attaching the radiator to the bracket so
18:48
the outflow exits the top of the case
18:50
there's a series of screws that attach
18:52
the radiator to the channel on the
18:54
bracket screw these in with the bracket
18:56
attached raise the radiator rator and
18:58
bracket into the case and Slide the
19:00
bracket into place there are two screws
19:03
that hold the bracket in place screw
AIO Cooler
19:05
these back in the cables for the fans
19:07
are along the back left of the
19:09
motherboard these can run through the
19:11
channel on the case to the back of the
19:13
case to hook up shortly to the AIO with
19:15
the radiator installed it's time to
19:17
attach the cooler to the CPU the most
19:20
important step in this process is to
19:22
remove the plastic cover on the cooler
19:24
plate this is a common mistake made by
19:27
new builders that can cause the CPU to
19:29
overheat and throttle so always triple
19:32
check that the plastic cover is removed
19:34
now it's time to apply thermal paste
19:36
typically the smaller square-shaped CPUs
19:39
require a simple psize dot of thermal
19:42
paast but the LGA 1700 size is larger
19:45
and more rectangular this requires a
19:48
somewhat larger psize dot in the center
19:51
and four smaller dots in the corners to
19:54
ensure good coverage on the CPU with the
19:56
thermal paste applied it's time to
19:59
install the cooler place the cooler down
20:01
on the CPU lining up the holes of the
20:03
cooler to the four screws of the back
20:05
plate now insert the four screws for the
20:08
cooler start with a simple hand thread
20:10
to keep the screws in place then with a
20:12
screwdriver start screwing the screws in
20:15
a star pattern tightening a full turn on
20:18
alternating screws to apply pressure
20:21
evenly on the CPU tighten the screws
20:23
until they give resistance you don't
20:26
want to overtighten but you do want make
20:28
sure that Each corner is evenly
20:30
tightened down the AO pump has some
20:33
cables running out that will plug into
20:35
the motherboard there's a controller
20:37
cable that plugs into the aiio pump
20:39
connection along the top of the
20:41
motherboard this controls the speed of
20:43
the aiio pump there's one USB header
20:46
that will run along the back of the case
20:48
to the USB connection along the bottom
20:50
of the motherboard there's also a SATA
20:53
power cable that will run along the back
20:55
of the case to one of the SATA power
20:56
plugs on the cable from the power power
20:58
supply next is another 5volt cable for
21:01
the argb which plugs into the aiio pump
21:04
and it runs to the 5vol port along the
21:07
top right of the motherboard there's an
21:08
included y cable which plugs into the
21:11
AIO pump this is for the two fan cables
21:14
for the fans attached to the radiator
21:16
now that the cooler is all set we'll
21:18
move on to the hard drives we have two 3
Hard Drives
21:20
and 1/2 in hard drives and two 2.5 in
21:23
ssds that will'll install the hard drive
21:26
enclosure has trays that hold the two
21:28
two 3.5 in drives we'll slide those out
21:30
and remove them for the ssds there's a
21:33
bracket that attaches to the back of the
21:35
case that holds two 2.5 in SSD drives
21:39
there's grommets and screws that hold
21:41
the drives into the trays and bracket
21:43
for the trays we installed the grommets
21:45
and attached the drives with the screws
21:47
you can attach the screws and the
21:49
grommets to the drives directly and then
21:51
slide them into the tray it works either
21:53
way for the hard drive enclosure you
21:55
want to make sure the data and power
21:57
ports are pointing to the rear of the
21:59
tray so they can be accessible by the
22:01
cables the SSD bracket is offset
22:04
allowing for a drive on either side
22:07
again we inserted the grommets and then
22:09
screwed the drives into place ensuring
22:11
that the data and power ports are facing
22:13
the open channels in the middle for the
22:15
cables there's eight SATA data ports on
22:18
the motherboard since we're only using
22:20
two M2 ssds and one GPU the 13900 K
22:24
paired with the Asus z790 Creator board
22:27
has have plenty of lanes to fill all
22:30
eight SATA ports with hard drives if we
22:32
wanted to but we're only going to use
22:34
four ports along the side of the
22:36
motherboard for now we'll install the
22:38
four cables first and run them to the
22:39
back of the case we have the SATA power
22:42
cables already plugged into the power
22:44
supply and running to some of the fans
22:46
so we'll use those to power the rest of
22:48
the drives Mount the hard drive
22:49
enclosure to the back of the case with
22:51
the tray facing the hole in the case
22:53
screw the four screws and place the
22:55
cover plate over the drives plug in the
22:57
the data and power cables to the 3 and
22:59
1/2 in drives then install the data and
23:02
power cables install the SSD bracket
23:05
over the back of the case with the top
23:06
and bottom screws with the drives all
23:09
set we're ready to install the GPU
The GPU
23:11
installing the GPU is another easy part
23:13
of building a PC we want to install the
23:16
card in the top pcie connection on the
23:18
motherboard so there's good airf flow
23:20
under the card the top and middle slots
23:22
on this motherboard are both pcie 5.0
23:25
speeds but we always want to use the top
23:28
slot the I/O plate on the card has two
23:30
feet that insert into the back of the
23:32
case we'll need to remove the second and
23:35
third PCI slot bracket first each
23:37
bracket has a screw holding it in place
23:40
line up the io plate of the card to the
23:42
back of the case and Slide the card down
23:44
the feet of the plate should catch in
23:46
the case and the connectors on the
23:48
bottom of the card will slide into the
23:50
connection you'll feel a click when the
23:51
card locks into place use the pcie
23:54
bracket screws to secure the plate of
23:56
the card to the case now now just run
23:58
the 12vt high power cable to the card
24:00
and plug it in with all of the
24:02
components installed the build is
24:04
complete this is a good time to do any
24:06
cable management in the back of the case
24:08
if you choose though I will say this is
24:10
a step most people skip if the cables
24:13
fit then you're good to go insert the
24:14
glass panels and screw them back into
Close it up
24:16
place attach the back panel and top
24:19
panels and screw those back into place
24:20
as well with the PC built it's time to
24:23
turn it on for the first time insert the
24:25
power cable and make sure the switch on
24:27
the power supply is turned on attach a
24:29
monitor keyboard and mouse and you're
24:31
ready to go hit the power button on the
Power On
24:33
case and the computer will turn on if
24:35
for any reason the computer does not
24:37
turn on remove the power cable and
24:39
double check all of your cable
24:41
connections when the PC powers on for
24:43
the first time pay attention to the
24:45
lights on the motherboard it'll show
24:46
what components post to ensure they're
24:48
working properly there's a light for the
24:50
CPU Ram VGA and the boot watch these
24:54
lights and make sure that each one goes
24:56
in sequence when the PC boots you'll be
24:58

Using a cheaper SSD setup still gives plenty of speed while cutting costs by $1,000+.

Opting for a mid-range motherboard & PSU saves another $200-$400.

Would you like me to tweak the parts list based on your specific needs and budget?

You said:
DP oi NEED WATER COOLING??
ChatGPT said:
No, you don’t need water cooling unless you plan to overclock or want silent operation.

Alternatives to Water Cooling:
Air Cooling: A high-end air cooler like the Noctua NH-D15 ($100) or DeepCool AK620 ($70) will keep temperatures low without the risks of liquid cooling.

Water Cooling (AIO): A 360mm AIO (like DeepCool LT720) is useful for an i9-13900K because it runs hot, but for an i7-13700K or Ryzen 9 7900X, high-end air cooling is enough.

When to Choose Air vs. Water Cooling:
Use Case	Air Cooling (Noctua NH-D15, DeepCool AK620)	Water Cooling (AIO 240mm-360mm)
Silent Operation	✅ Quieter	❌ Pump noise
Ease of Installation	✅ Simple, no leaks	❌ More complex, risk of leaks
Longevity	✅ No pump failures	❌ Pump lifespan ~5 years
Overclocking	❌ Limited	✅ Better cooling for OC
Aesthetic (RGB, clean look)	❌ Basic design	✅ Looks more modern
Recommended Choice for Your Build:
If you get an i7-13700K or Ryzen 9 7900X → Go with air cooling (Noctua NH-D15, DeepCool AK620)

If you get an i9-13900K → Consider a 360mm AIO (DeepCool LT720, Lian Li Galahad 2 Trinity)

Bottom Line: Air cooling is enough for most users unless you need extreme performance and overclocking. Want the safest, simplest solution? Go with air cooling! 🚀

PC Build Cost Comparison


I've provided a side-by-side cost comparison of the MicroCenter Build vs. the Budget Alternative Build. Let me know if you need any adjustments or more details on specific components! 🚀 

You said:
most inportant for me on the mother  board is multiple M2 slots at least 4 that can be used for HDD.  then still have a slot open for PCIE GPU  also need at leset three Sata ports.  I am not sure how those interact and what the limitations are . I know there is an issue with pcie slots and m2 hdd can you explain that
ChatGPT said:
PCIe and M.2 Slot Interaction Explained
M.2 NVMe SSDs and PCIe slots share bandwidth on most consumer motherboards. The number of M.2 drives and PCIe slots you can use simultaneously depends on the CPU lanes and motherboard chipset design.

How PCIe Lanes Work
CPU has a limited number of PCIe lanes (e.g., Intel i7-13700K has 20 lanes, Ryzen 9 7900X has 24 lanes).

M.2 SSDs use PCIe lanes. Each M.2 NVMe SSD typically uses 4 lanes.

GPU uses PCIe lanes. A GPU normally takes 16 lanes, but some motherboards reduce this to 8 lanes if multiple M.2 drives are installed.

SATA ports may share bandwidth with M.2 slots. Some M.2 slots disable a SATA port when occupied.

What This Means for You
You need:
✅ 4+ M.2 slots that can be used for NVMe SSDs and/or SATA M.2 drives
✅ PCIe slot open for a GPU while using the M.2 slots
✅ At least 3 SATA ports available after using the M.2 slots

Motherboard Considerations
Check the motherboard manual: Some boards disable PCIe lanes or SATA ports when M.2 slots are in use.

Look for a board with dedicated chipset lanes: Some high-end boards have additional PCIe lanes managed by the chipset, reducing lane conflicts.

Avoid boards where the 3rd or 4th M.2 slot disables the GPU’s full 16 lanes.

Consider a PCIe M.2 adapter: If needed, you can use a PCIe adapter card for additional M.2 drives.

Recommended Motherboards That Fit Your Needs
These motherboards support 4+ M.2 slots, allow a GPU, and still have 3+ SATA ports:

Intel Z790 Options:
ASUS ProArt Z790 Creator WiFi ($450)

4x M.2 slots

PCIe 5.0 x16 for GPU

4x SATA ports

Thunderbolt 4 support

MSI MEG Z790 ACE ($500)

5x M.2 slots

PCIe 5.0 x16 (reduces to x8 if multiple M.2 are used)

6x SATA ports

Best if you plan to expand storage further

AMD AM5 Options:
ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero ($550)

4x M.2 slots

PCIe 5.0 x16 for GPU

6x SATA ports

Future-proof with PCIe 5.0 support for storage

Gigabyte X670 AORUS Master ($350)

4x M.2 slots

PCIe 5.0 x16 for GPU

4x SATA ports

More affordable while still supporting high-end storage needs

Conclusion
If you want Intel, go for ASUS ProArt Z790 Creator or MSI MEG Z790 ACE.

If you want AMD, go for ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero or Gigabyte X670 AORUS Master.

All these boards allow a GPU + 4+ M.2 SSDs + at least 3 SATA ports without lane conflicts.

Would you like me to adjust based on budget or specific features (Thunderbolt, WiFi, etc.)? 🚀

ChatGPT said:
Got it! Let’s break it down into "Noticeable" vs. "Not Noticeable" impacts, so you can decide whether the price savings of an i7-13700K are worth it for your workflow.

Switching from i9-13900K to i7-13700K: What You'll Notice vs. What You Won't
Task	Noticeable Difference?	How It Affects You
Basic Video Editing (4K Timeline, Cutting Clips, Arranging Footage)	❌ Not Noticeable	Both CPUs feel identical. No lag, no delay.
Timeline Scrubbing (4K Footage, Multiple Layers, Effects Applied)	⚠️ Slightly Noticeable	If you scroll quickly through footage, the i9 is a bit smoother. On i7, you may see occasional micro-stutters when scrubbing through multiple layers of 4K video.
Timeline Scrubbing (8K Footage, Heavy Effects Applied)	✅ Very Noticeable	The i7 will stutter more often, requiring "Proxy Mode" or lower playback quality. If you work in 8K often, you'll want the i9.
Rendering a Final Video (Export Speed, 4K)	⚠️ Slightly Noticeable (5-10% Slower)	If a video export takes 10 minutes on the i9, it takes 11-12 minutes on the i7. Not a big deal unless exporting multiple projects daily.
Rendering a Final Video (Export Speed, 8K or Multi-Layer 4K)	✅ Noticeable (15-20% Slower)	A 30-minute export on the i9 could take 35-38 minutes on the i7. If you do long, complex projects daily, this adds up.
Multitasking While Editing (Premiere + Photoshop + After Effects Open at the Same Time)	✅ Noticeable	With the i7, switching between programs feels slightly less snappy. If you run all three at once, you may get slowdowns when switching between windows.
Applying Effects (Color Grading, Noise Reduction, Lumetri, Optical Flow, AI Features in Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve)	⚠️ Slightly Noticeable	AI-driven effects take 1-3 seconds longer per adjustment on the i7. If you use lots of color grading or stabilization, this could be annoying over time.
Encoding in H.264, H.265 (GPU-Assisted, Normal Exports)	❌ Not Noticeable	Both CPUs have the same hardware encoding acceleration for H.264 and H.265. No real difference unless using CPU-only encoding.
Heavy CPU Rendering (RAW Video Processing, ProRes Exports, CPU-Only Rendering in After Effects or Blender)	✅ Very Noticeable (30-40% Slower)	If your workflow relies on CPU rendering instead of GPU, the i9 makes a big difference. Not relevant if you're using NVENC GPU encoding.
Final Recommendation:
If you're working mostly in 4K and don’t need ultra-fast exports → Go with the i7-13700K. 95% of the time, you won’t notice a difference.

If you edit 8K, do advanced color grading, and run multiple Adobe apps at the same time → Get the i9-13900K. The performance boost is noticeable in those cases.

If you want a better balance, consider the AMD Ryzen 9 7900X → Slightly cheaper than the i9, but performs better than the i7.

ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Final Recommendation Based on Your Workflow:
Since you don’t do color grading and use HitFilm Express, the i7-13700K is the better choice for you. Here’s why:

✅ No noticeable difference in basic video editing (cutting, arranging, rendering 4K video).
✅ No noticeable difference in export speeds for H.264/H.265 (HitFilm uses GPU acceleration).
✅ Saves you money ($200+) without sacrificing performance in your current workflow.
✅ Technology will change by the time you need advanced editing features, so it’s better to save now and upgrade later.

The i9-13900K only makes sense if you:

Work with 8K footage (which you don’t).

Use AI-based effects or heavy CPU rendering (which you don’t).

Need to multitask across multiple editing tools at once (not a priority for you).

💡 Final Decision: Stick with the i7-13700K and use that extra money for more storage or a better GPU 🚀.

what is encoding and how does it impact my experience
ChatGPT said:
What is Encoding and How Does It Impact Your Video Editing Experience?
Encoding is the process of converting your raw video files into a compressed format (like H.264, H.265, or ProRes) so they can be saved, uploaded, or streamed efficiently.

How It Affects Your Experience
Export Speed (Rendering Time)

When you finish editing and hit "Export" in HitFilm, the software encodes your video into the final format.

A faster encoder = shorter export times.

NVENC (NVIDIA’s hardware encoder) makes this much faster.

Playback Performance (Timeline Scrubbing & Editing)

If your footage is in a highly compressed format (like H.265 or 4K/8K files), your CPU & GPU decode it while you edit.

A powerful GPU (like an RTX 4070 Super) smooths playback so you don’t get stutters while scrubbing.

File Size vs. Quality Trade-Offs

H.264 → Small file size, decent quality (best for YouTube, streaming).

H.265 → Smaller file size, same quality (harder to edit, needs better hardware).

ProRes → Huge file size, best quality (used in professional editing, but you don’t need it).

How NVIDIA NVENC Helps You
✅ Faster Exports – A GPU with NVENC (like RTX 4070 Super) exports 3-4x faster than CPU-only encoding.
✅ Smoother Playback – Less lag when working with compressed formats (H.265, 4K footage).
✅ Doesn’t Overload Your CPU – Leaves your CPU free to handle other tasks while encoding happens on the GPU.

💡 Bottom Line:
Since HitFilm Express supports NVENC, an RTX 4070 Super will greatly speed up your exports and timeline playback compared to using just the CPU. 🚀

You said:
why would they go with 5600 instead of 6000  thye had unlimited budget
ChatGPT said:
Why Did MicroCenter Choose DDR5-5600 Instead of DDR5-6000?
Even with an unlimited budget, MicroCenter likely chose DDR5-5600 for one or more of these reasons:

1. Guaranteed Stability with 128GB of RAM
When using four sticks (4x32GB) instead of two (2x32GB), higher speeds (like DDR5-6000) can cause instability due to motherboard and CPU memory controller limitations.

DDR5-5600 is the “safe” choice because it ensures reliability without needing manual BIOS tuning.

✅ For 128GB setups, 5600 is the safest choice.
❌ For 64GB (2x32GB), 6000 is stable and faster.

2. Intel Officially Supports DDR5-5600 (Not 6000)
Intel 13th & 14th Gen CPUs (like i9-13900K & i7-13700K) officially support:

DDR5-5600 with 2 sticks (2x32GB)

DDR5-4400 with 4 sticks (4x32GB)

DDR5-6000 works, but requires EXPO/XMP overclocking, which is not always stable in high-capacity configurations.

✅ DDR5-5600 is plug-and-play with no tuning required.
⚠️ DDR5-6000 needs motherboard & BIOS tuning for stability.

3. Real-World Editing Performance: No Noticeable Gain Above 5600
DDR5-6000 is only ~2-3% faster than DDR5-5600 in video editing.

The biggest factors for smooth timeline scrubbing are GPU performance, storage speed (NVMe SSDs), and CPU efficiency, not RAM speed alone.

✅ DDR5-6000 is slightly better, but in real-world editing, it’s barely noticeable.
❌ If you had an unlimited budget, RAM speed would not be a major priority.

What This Means for Your Build
Since you only need 64GB (2x32GB), DDR5-6000 CL30 is a great choice.

If you were going with 128GB (4x32GB), DDR5-5600 would be the better option for stability.

💡 Final Answer:

MicroCenter chose 5600 because it ensures stability with 128GB (4 sticks).

You should stick with DDR5-6000 CL30 because you’re only using 64GB (2 sticks), which keeps things fast and stable. 🚀

You said:
will I have to tweak the bios:  DDR5-6000 needs motherboard & BIOS tuning for stability.
ChatGPT said:
Will You Need to Tweak the BIOS for DDR5-6000?
Yes, but it’s simple. DDR5-6000 will require enabling XMP (Intel) or EXPO (AMD) in the BIOS, but it’s just a one-click setting in most cases.

Steps to Enable DDR5-6000 in the BIOS
Enter BIOS

Restart your PC and press Delete (Del) or F2 during boot.

Enable XMP (Intel) / EXPO (AMD)

Look for XMP (Extreme Memory Profile) if using Intel.

Look for EXPO (Extended Profiles for Overclocking) if using AMD.

Set it to XMP Profile 1 (or EXPO Profile 1 for AMD).

Save & Exit

Press F10 to save and reboot.

✅ That’s it! You don’t need to adjust voltages, timings, or other settings.

Will There Be Stability Issues?
With 2 sticks (2x32GB), DDR5-6000 should be stable on most Z790 motherboards.

If the system doesn’t boot or crashes:

Try XMP Profile 2 (if available) for a slightly more relaxed setting.

Lower to DDR5-5600 manually if instability occurs.

💡 Bottom Line:

For your 64GB (2x32GB) setup, enabling XMP is all you need.

No deep BIOS tweaking required—just a simple setting change. 🚀

ook so explain what the z790 desgination is.  there are many z790s and I dont understand what the designation z790 should mean to me when I se it
ChatGPT said:
What Does "Z790" Mean?
The Z790 designation is Intel's chipset name for high-end motherboards designed for Intel 12th, 13th, and 14th Gen CPUs (like your i7-13700K).

Think of "Z790" as the "brain" of the motherboard. Every motherboard with "Z790" shares certain features, but different models have different extra features based on brand and price.

Breaking Down the Naming:
"Z" = High-end chipset

Z790 → Full PCIe 5.0 support, best expandability.

B760 → Mid-range (fewer M.2 slots, fewer PCIe lanes).

H770 → Lower-end, limited features.

"790" = The generation

Z790 (latest, best for 13th & 14th Gen Intel CPUs)

Z690 (older, works but less PCIe 5.0 support)

💡 Key takeaway: If you see Z790, it's a high-end, feature-packed motherboard that will support your CPU with max expandability.

Why Are There So Many Different Z790 Models?
Different manufacturers (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, ASRock) make multiple Z790 boards at different price points with different features.

Here’s how they differ:

Feature	Budget Z790 (~$200-250)	Mid-Range Z790 (~$300-400)	High-End Z790 (~$450-600+)
M.2 Slots	Usually 3	4	4-5
PCIe 5.0 Support	GPU only, no M.2	GPU + 1 M.2	Full PCIe 5.0 for GPU & Storage
SATA Ports	4-6	4-6	4-6
VRMs (Power Stability)	⚠️ Basic, fine for i7	✅ Good stability	✅ Extreme overclocking support
Extra Features (WiFi 6E, Thunderbolt 4, More USB)	❌ Limited	✅ Good balance	✅ Loaded with ports
What the Z790 Name Means for You
Since you care about expandability & stability, here’s what you should look for in Z790 models:
✅ At least 3-4 M.2 slots
✅ A full x16 PCIe 5.0 slot for your GPU (so storage doesn’t slow it down)
✅ At least 4 SATA ports (for HDDs/extra storage)
✅ Good VRMs (so your i7-13700K runs stable)

How to Pick the Right Z790 for You
Since not all Z790 motherboards are the same, look for:
1️⃣ “ProArt” / “Creator” / “AORUS Master” → Built for stability & creators.
2️⃣ “Gaming” or “Strix” → Balanced for both gamers & creators.
3️⃣ Avoid entry-level Z790s (~$200-250) if you want more than 3 M.2 slots.

💡 Final Takeaway:

Z790 guarantees high-end features, but you still need to check M.2 slots, PCIe layout, and stability features.

It’s a chipset, not a specific motherboard model.

Would you like help picking a specific Z790 motherboard now based on this? 🚀

ChatGPT said:
PCIe 4.0 vs. PCIe 5.0: Do You Need PCIe 5.0 for Video Editing?
You’ve seen videos saying PCIe 5.0 isn’t necessary, and they are mostly correct for video editing. Let’s break it down so you can decide whether PCIe 5.0 matters for your build.

What is PCIe?
PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) is the high-speed connection on your motherboard used for GPUs, SSDs, and expansion cards.

The difference between PCIe 4.0 and PCIe 5.0 is bandwidth (speed per lane).

PCIe Version	Speed Per Lane (GB/s)	Total Bandwidth (x16 Slot for GPU)	Used for
PCIe 3.0 (Old)	1 GB/s per lane	16 GB/s (x16 slot)	Older GPUs, SSDs
PCIe 4.0 (Current Standard)	2 GB/s per lane	32 GB/s (x16 slot)	RTX 3000/4000 GPUs, NVMe SSDs
PCIe 5.0 (New)	4 GB/s per lane	64 GB/s (x16 slot)	RTX 5000 GPUs (future), next-gen SSDs
Does PCIe 5.0 Matter for Video Editing?
✅ For GPUs: No difference at all – Even high-end GPUs (like RTX 4090) do not fully use PCIe 4.0, let alone PCIe 5.0.
✅ For NVMe SSDs: Very little real-world impact – PCIe 5.0 SSDs are faster on paper, but video editing rarely benefits from them.
✅ For Stability: PCIe 5.0 runs hotter and sometimes causes stability issues, while PCIe 4.0 is proven and reliable.

💡 Conclusion: PCIe 4.0 is more than enough for your needs. PCIe 5.0 isn't necessary for video editing today and won’t be for at least another 3-5 years.

So Why Do Motherboards Advertise PCIe 5.0?
🔹 Marketing Hype – It’s future-proofing, but doesn’t help today’s hardware.
🔹 Next-Gen SSDs & GPUs – Might help future hardware, but today’s SSDs & GPUs don’t need it.
🔹 High-End Overclocking Builds – PCIe 5.0 motherboards are mostly for extreme builds.

Best Choice for You
Stick with PCIe 4.0 for SSDs and GPU. No performance loss.

Only pay extra for PCIe 5.0 if the motherboard has other features you need (M.2 slots, stability, ports).

A Z790 motherboard with PCIe 4.0 support is perfectly fine.

Would you like me to filter your motherboard choices to only focus on Z790 boards with PCIe 4.0 to save money? 🚀

You said:

I want to run 5 and maybe 6 monitors. currently I have 3 monitors hooked up to the GPU and 2 hooked up to a J5% creator hub.  I am having stabnility issues with 6 monotrs aso I need this build to handle multiple screens.  how many monitor slots does the 4070 have?
ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
How Many Monitors Can the RTX 4070 (Non-Super & Super) Support?
Both the RTX 4070 (Non-Super) and RTX 4070 Super have the following display outputs:

Output Type	Number of Ports	Max Resolution per Port
DisplayPort 1.4a	3 Ports	4K @ 240Hz / 8K @ 60Hz
HDMI 2.1	1 Port	4K @ 120Hz / 8K @ 60Hz
🔹 Total Monitor Support: Up to 4 displays natively (3 via DisplayPort + 1 via HDMI).

How to Connect 5-6 Monitors on This Build
Since the 4070 only has 4 outputs, you need extra ports to reach 5 or 6 monitors:

Option 1: Use the Motherboard’s iGPU Outputs (If Available)
Your i7-13700K has an integrated GPU (Intel UHD 770).

Some Z790 motherboards allow using the HDMI/DP outputs while the GPU is active.

Check the motherboard specs to confirm "Hybrid Multi-Monitor" support.

💡 Best Motherboards for This:
✅ ASUS ProArt Z790 Creator WiFi (Has HDMI + DisplayPort on the motherboard)
✅ Gigabyte Z790 AORUS Elite AX (Also has extra ports)

Option 2: Use a DisplayPort MST Hub (Best Choice for Stability)
MST (Multi-Stream Transport) hubs let you daisy-chain 3+ monitors from one DisplayPort.

Example: Club3D MST Hub (DisplayPort 1.4 to 3x DP Outputs) (~$80).

More stable than USB display adapters (like J5Create, which can cause lag/crashes).

🔹 Best Setup:

3 monitors via native GPU DisplayPort

1 monitor via GPU HDMI

1-2 monitors via a DisplayPort MST hub

Option 3: Add a Secondary GPU (Not Recommended Unless Necessary)
A cheap secondary GPU (like a GT 1030) could add extra monitor support.

Downside: Extra power draw, potential driver conflicts.

Final Recommendation
✅ Use an MST Hub (Best stability, avoids software issues).
✅ Pick a motherboard with HDMI/DP ports that allow iGPU + dGPU usage.
✅ Avoid USB-based display adapters (they cause lag & instability).

Would you like me to adjust the motherboard choice to ensure extra video outputs? 🚀

what is  iGPU + dGPU usage.
ChatGPT said:
What is iGPU + dGPU Usage?
iGPU (Integrated GPU) + dGPU (Dedicated GPU) usage means using both your CPU's built-in graphics and your discrete graphics card (RTX 4070) at the same time to power multiple monitors.

What’s the Difference?
Type	What It Does	Where It’s Located	Powerful Enough for Video Editing?
iGPU (Integrated GPU)	Handles basic graphics & extra displays	Built into your CPU (Intel UHD 770 in i7-13700K)	❌ Not powerful for video editing but fine for extra monitors
dGPU (Dedicated GPU)	Handles high-performance graphics, video editing, gaming	A separate graphics card (RTX 4070)	✅ Best for video editing & main monitors
Why Would You Use Both?
Because the RTX 4070 only has 4 monitor outputs, you can use the iGPU’s HDMI/DisplayPort outputs from the motherboard to power extra monitors.

💡 Example Setup Using Both iGPU + dGPU:

3 monitors on the RTX 4070 (via DisplayPort)

1 monitor on the RTX 4070 (via HDMI)

1 monitor on the motherboard’s HDMI (powered by iGPU)

1 monitor on the motherboard’s DisplayPort (powered by iGPU)

✅ This allows up to 6 monitors without needing a hub or extra GPU.

How to Enable iGPU + dGPU in BIOS
Enter BIOS (Press Delete (Del) or F2 when booting).

Look for "Multi-Monitor" or "iGPU Multi-Monitor" (in Advanced Graphics settings).

Enable iGPU while keeping dGPU as the primary GPU.

Save & Exit (F10).

Plug additional monitors into the motherboard’s video ports.

Limitations of iGPU for Extra Monitors
⚠️ The iGPU is only for display output. It will not help with video editing performance.
⚠️ Not all motherboards support iGPU + dGPU at the same time. You need a motherboard that allows "Hybrid Multi-Monitor Mode."

Best Motherboards for iGPU + dGPU Support
✅ ASUS ProArt Z790 Creator WiFi (Has HDMI & DP on motherboard)
✅ Gigabyte Z790 AORUS Elite AX (Also has extra HDMI & DP ports)

💡 Final Recommendation: If you want 5-6 monitors without adapters, choose a motherboard with HDMI + DisplayPort on the motherboard, then enable iGPU + dGPU in BIOS.

Would you like to lock in a motherboard that supports iGPU + dGPU for your build? 🚀

in the terms of  "If you transfer large files", define large
ChatGPT said:
What Counts as "Large Files" in This Context?
For video editing, file sizes depend on resolution, codec, and compression. Here’s what I mean when I say "large files":

1️⃣ Video File Size Breakdown
Video Format & Resolution	File Size per Minute	File Size per Hour
1080p H.264 (Standard YouTube/Streaming)	100MB - 500MB	6GB - 30GB
4K H.264 (Standard Editing)	500MB - 1.5GB	30GB - 90GB
4K ProRes 422 (High-Quality Editing)	6GB - 10GB	360GB - 600GB
4K ProRes RAW / Cinema DNG (High-End)	20GB - 40GB	1.2TB - 2.4TB
8K ProRes RAW / REDCODE RAW (Professional Film Work)	50GB - 100GB+	3TB - 6TB+
🔹 If you’re working with standard 4K H.264 files (30GB-90GB per hour), Thunderbolt 4 or 10Gb LAN is unnecessary.
🔹 If you're dealing with 4K ProRes (360GB+ per hour), Thunderbolt 4 or 10Gb LAN can save time.
🔹 For RAW formats (1.2TB+ per hour), high-speed storage is essential.

2️⃣ How File Transfer Speed Impacts Workflow
Connection Type	Real-World Speed	Time to Transfer 100GB
SATA SSD (Internal or External via USB 3.2 Gen 1)	~500MB/s	~3.5 minutes
NVMe SSD (PCIe 4.0, Internal)	~3,500MB/s	~30 seconds
Thunderbolt 4 SSD (External, PCIe 3.0 Speeds)	~2,800MB/s	~40 seconds
10Gb Ethernet (Fast Network Storage - NAS)	~1,000MB/s	~1.6 minutes
1Gb Ethernet (Standard Network Storage - NAS)	~100MB/s	~16 minutes
🔹 If your files are under ~100GB, standard NVMe SSDs and USB 3.2 are fast enough.
🔹 If you're moving 500GB+ frequently, 10Gb LAN or Thunderbolt 4 is beneficial.

3️⃣ Do You Need Thunderbolt 4 or 10Gb LAN?
NO → If you work with H.264 4K files (30GB-90GB per hour), a PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD inside your PC is already fast enough.

MAYBE → If you regularly move 100GB+ projects between multiple computers or use an external SSD, Thunderbolt 4 helps.

YES → If you edit directly from a NAS or frequently transfer 500GB+ of ProRes or RAW footage, 10Gb LAN is useful.

Final Answer for Your Workflow
Since you’re using HitFilm Express (which doesn’t rely on RAW or ProRes files), you likely don’t need Thunderbolt 4 or 10Gb LAN.

💡 Recommendation:
✅ Save $180-$200 and get the Gigabyte Z790 AORUS Elite ($270) or MSI MAG Z790 Tomahawk ($250).
⚠️ Only get the ASUS ProArt Z790 Creator ($450) if you expect to move 100GB+ projects frequently.

i thought thunderbolt was for monitors  how does it help with file trnafer
ChatGPT said:
What is Thunderbolt and How Does It Help with File Transfers?
Thunderbolt is a high-speed data transfer and display connection standard developed by Intel and Apple. It can be used for both monitors and storage devices, but its real strength is in fast external file transfers.

1️⃣ How Thunderbolt 4 Helps with File Transfers
Thunderbolt 4 allows extremely fast external storage speeds, making it ideal for moving large video files between SSDs or network drives.

Connection Type	Max Speed (Theoretical)	Real-World File Transfer Speed
USB 3.2 Gen 2 (Standard USB-C or USB-A)	10 Gbps	~1,000 MB/s (~1GB per sec)
USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (Some newer USB-C ports)	20 Gbps	~2,000 MB/s (~2GB per sec)
Thunderbolt 3 / 4 (USB-C port, Intel motherboards)	40 Gbps	~2,800 MB/s (~2.8GB per sec)
💡 Why It Matters: If you use external SSDs (like Samsung X5 or SanDisk Extreme Pro) to store or move your video projects, Thunderbolt cuts transfer time significantly.

2️⃣ Thunderbolt 4 vs. USB for External SSDs
Use Case	USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10Gbps)	Thunderbolt 4 (40Gbps)	Real-World Impact
Moving a 100GB 4K Video Project	~1.5 minutes	~30 seconds	✅ Thunderbolt is ~3x faster
Editing Directly from External SSD	⚠️ May stutter on large files	✅ Runs smoothly	✅ Great for working off an external drive
Using External NVMe SSD (RAID Storage, Scratch Disks)	⚠️ Slower, bottlenecked at ~1GB/s	✅ Much faster (~2.8GB/s)	✅ Faster video scrubbing
🔹 If you move projects between computers or work from an external SSD, Thunderbolt 4 is a game-changer.
🔹 If you only store files internally on PCIe 4.0 SSDs, you don’t need Thunderbolt.

3️⃣ Thunderbolt 4 for Monitors
Yes, Thunderbolt can also be used for displays, but you don’t need it for multiple monitors in your setup.

Use Case	Does Thunderbolt Help?	Better Alternative
Connecting 5-6 monitors	❌ No (Not needed, GPU + iGPU handles it)	✅ Use GPU + iGPU HDMI/DP outputs
Using a High-Resolution 4K/8K Display	⚠️ Maybe (Only if your monitor supports it)	✅ Use DisplayPort or HDMI instead
🔹 For your setup (5-6 monitors), Thunderbolt is unnecessary.

4️⃣ Should You Pay Extra for Thunderbolt 4?
✅ Get Thunderbolt 4 if you:

Move 100GB+ files between devices often.

Work off an external SSD instead of an internal NVMe drive.

Use professional RAID storage solutions.

❌ Skip Thunderbolt 4 if you:

Store everything inside your PC.

Don’t transfer huge files daily.

Are only concerned with multiple monitors (iGPU + dGPU handles this).

Final Recommendation
💰 Best Value: Gigabyte Z790 AORUS Elite ($270) or MSI MAG Z790 Tomahawk ($250) → No Thunderbolt, but supports iGPU + dGPU for 6 monitors.
💎 Only Get ASUS ProArt Z790 Creator ($450) if you need ultra-fast external SSD speeds for 100GB+ file transfers regularly.

Storage Type	Real-World Speed	Time to Transfer 100GB
PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD (Internal M.2 SSD)	3,500 MB/s	~30 seconds
SATA SSD (Internal or External via USB 3.2 Gen 2)	500 MB/s	~3.5 minutes
Enterprise HDD (WD Gold, Seagate IronWolf Pro)	250 MB/s	~7 minutes
Consumer HDD (WD Elements, Seagate Barracuda)	150 MB/s	~11 minutes
External HDD via USB 3.0 (2.5” Portable Drives)	80-120 MB/s	~14-20 minutes
🔹 Your NVMe SSD can read/write files at 3,500MB/s, but your HDD can only write at ~200MB/s.
🔹 So, transferring large files will be limited by the HDD’s slower speed.

2️⃣ How to Minimize HDD Transfer Bottlenecks
✅ Use Enterprise HDDs (WD Gold, Seagate IronWolf Pro) → Faster, ~250 MB/s vs. 150 MB/s on consumer drives.
✅ Use a RAID 0 Setup → Combines multiple HDDs for faster speeds (but no redundancy).
✅ Use a Dedicated NAS with 10Gb Ethernet → Faster than USB, but requires a network setup.
✅ Keep Your Active Projects on an NVMe SSD → Only move completed projects to HDD archives.

3️⃣ When to Consider SSD Instead of HDD for Archive Storage
If you frequently move large projects back and forth from archive storage, consider SATA SSDs instead of HDDs for a better balance between cost and speed:

Option	Speed	Cost per TB	Best For
HDD (WD Gold, Seagate IronWolf Pro)	~200 MB/s	$15-$25/TB	✅ Best for cold storage (long-term, infrequent access)
SATA SSD (Crucial MX500, Samsung 870 QVO)	~500 MB/s	$50-$100/TB	✅ Best for faster archive access
NVMe SSD (Samsung 990 Pro, WD Black SN850X)	~3,500 MB/s	$80-$150/TB	✅ Best for working drive (active projects)
4️⃣ Best Strategy for Your Workflow
1️⃣ Use an NVMe SSD (PCIe 4.0) as your active working drive.
2️⃣ Store completed projects on a fast HDD (WD Gold or Seagate IronWolf Pro).
3️⃣ If you need faster access to archived projects, use a SATA SSD instead of an HDD.
4️⃣ If you need to retrieve archived projects often, consider a NAS (Network Attached Storage) with 10Gb Ethernet for faster speeds.

Final Takeaway
✅ Yes, HDDs will be your bottleneck, but choosing enterprise-grade HDDs and optimizing your storage workflow will minimize the impact.
✅ If you frequently retrieve archived projects, consider mixing HDDs & SATA SSDs for a balance of cost and speed.

How Does Using Enterprise HDDs for Offline Storage Impact Your Motherboard Choice (Thunderbolt vs. SATA/NVMe)?
Since you are using enterprise HDDs (WD Gold, Seagate IronWolf Pro) as your long-term offline storage, let’s determine if Thunderbolt 4 is still useful or if you should prioritize other features on your motherboard.

1️⃣ Does Thunderbolt 4 Improve HDD Performance?
❌ No. Thunderbolt 4 doesn’t help HDD speed because HDDs are too slow to take advantage of it.

Connection Type	Max Speed	HDD Speed Bottleneck?
SATA 3 (Internal HDDs & SSDs)	6 Gbps (~550MB/s)	❌ No (SATA is already faster than HDDs)
USB 3.2 Gen 2 (External HDDs via USB-C)	10 Gbps (~1,000MB/s)	❌ No (HDDs only use ~200MB/s)
Thunderbolt 4 (External SSDs/NAS)	40 Gbps (~2,800MB/s)	✅ Yes (Overkill for HDDs)
🔹 HDDs are only ~200MB/s, so any SATA or USB 3.2 connection is already more than fast enough.
🔹 Thunderbolt 4 is only useful for high-speed external SSDs, not HDD-based storage.

2️⃣ Do You Need Thunderbolt 4 for Future NAS (Network Storage)?
If you plan to move beyond direct HDD storage and into a NAS (Network Attached Storage) system, then 10Gb Ethernet is more important than Thunderbolt.

Connection Type	Best For	HDD Bottleneck?
1Gb Ethernet (Standard Motherboards)	Basic file transfers (~100MB/s)	✅ HDDs are slower than this, so no bottleneck
10Gb Ethernet (ASUS ProArt, Some High-End Boards)	Fast shared storage (~1,000MB/s)	❌ Only needed for high-speed SSD NAS, not HDD NAS
Thunderbolt 4 (ASUS ProArt, Some High-End Boards)	Direct External SSDs	✅ Overkill for HDDs
💡 If you only use enterprise HDDs for archiving, 1Gb Ethernet or direct SATA is fine.
💡 If you plan to build a high-speed NAS with SSDs, then 10Gb Ethernet is useful.

3️⃣ What Motherboard Features Should You Prioritize Instead of Thunderbolt?
Since Thunderbolt 4 doesn’t benefit HDD-based storage, focus on these features instead:

✅ More SATA Ports → So you can attach multiple HDDs without losing connections.
✅ More M.2 Slots → So you can keep fast NVMe SSDs for active projects.
✅ 1Gb or 10Gb Ethernet → Useful if you plan to use a NAS in the future.
✅ Stable BIOS & Power Delivery → Since HDD storage is long-term, a reliable motherboard ensures no corruption from crashes.

4️⃣ Best Motherboard Choices (Without Paying for Unnecessary Thunderbolt 4)
Motherboard	M.2 Slots	SATA Ports	Thunderbolt 4?	10Gb Ethernet?	Price
MSI MAG Z790 Tomahawk WiFi	3x M.2	6 SATA	❌ No	❌ No (1Gb Ethernet)	$250
Gigabyte Z790 AORUS Elite AX	4x M.2	4 SATA	❌ No	❌ No (2.5Gb Ethernet)	$270
ASUS ProArt Z790 Creator WiFi	4x M.2	4 SATA	✅ Yes	✅ Yes (10Gb Ethernet)	$450
Final Answer: Do You Need Thunderbolt 4 for Enterprise HDD Storage?
❌ No, Thunderbolt 4 does nothing for HDD storage.
✅ Prioritize SATA ports, M.2 slots, and Ethernet speed instead.

💰 Best Choice: Gigabyte Z790 AORUS Elite AX ($270) → More M.2 slots, 4 SATA ports, and no wasted money on Thunderbolt.

You said:
i also hear d power phases are unneccesary if not overclocking
ChatGPT said:
Are High Power Phases Necessary If You’re Not Overclocking?
🔹 No, high power phases (VRMs) are not necessary if you’re running stock settings.
🔹 Yes, they help with power stability, but only matter for extreme overclocking or high-end CPUs like the i9-13900K.

1️⃣ What Are VRM Power Phases?
VRMs (Voltage Regulation Modules) control power delivery from the PSU to the CPU.

More power phases = smoother power delivery = better for overclocking.

If not overclocking, extra power phases don’t improve performance.

2️⃣ ASRock Z790 Taichi's VRMs (20+1+1 Power Phases) – Overkill?
This board has a 20+1+1 VRM setup, which is meant for extreme overclocking.

For an i7-13700K at stock speeds, you don’t need more than 14+1 power phases.

Excessive VRMs increase cost but don’t provide real-world benefits for non-overclockers.

3️⃣ Does This Mean You Should Avoid the ASRock Z790 Taichi?
Not necessarily, but you might be paying for power phases you don’t need.

💡 Alternative Choice:

ASRock Z790 Taichi Lite (~$380) → Fewer VRMs (still stable for stock speeds), cheaper than the standard Taichi.

ASUS ProArt Z790 Creator ($450) → Better BIOS stability, no unnecessary VRMs, 10Gb Ethernet.

4️⃣ Final Answer: Keep or Drop the ASRock Z790 Taichi?
❌ If you want to avoid paying for overkill VRMs → Consider ASRock Z790 Taichi Lite or ASUS ProArt Z790.
✅ If you’re okay with paying extra for premium build quality → Keep the ASRock Z790 Taichi.

Would you like to swap the Taichi for the Taichi Lite or another board that avoids overkill VRMs? 🚀

You said:
why did you recomend the wd for scrattch and the samsung for os
ChatGPT said:
Why Samsung 990 Pro for OS & WD Black SN850X for Scratch Disk?
Both Samsung 990 Pro and WD Black SN850X are top-tier PCIe 4.0 SSDs, but they have slight differences that make one better suited for the OS & Programs drive and the other for the Scratch Disk.

1️⃣ Why Samsung 990 Pro for OS & Programs?
✅ Faster Random Read/Write Speeds → Better for boot times & loading apps.
✅ Higher Endurance (TBW) → Longer lifespan with constant small file writes.
✅ Samsung's Best-in-Class Firmware & Reliability → Ensures stability.

🔹 OS & Applications do lots of small file reads/writes → The Samsung 990 Pro is optimized for this.
🔹 This means Windows will boot faster, programs will load quicker, and the drive will last longer.

2️⃣ Why WD Black SN850X for Scratch Disk?
✅ Consistently High Sequential Speeds → Great for large video files.
✅ Strong Sustained Write Performance → Handles constant video cache writing well.
✅ Less Expensive for Similar Performance → Saves ~$10-20 vs. Samsung.

🔹 A scratch disk needs fast sustained writes for video editing.
🔹 WD Black SN850X delivers top-tier sequential speeds without costing extra for OS-optimized firmware.

3️⃣ Does It Matter? Can You Swap Them?
✔️ Yes, you can swap them, and performance will still be excellent.
✔️ Both SSDs perform very similarly in real-world use.
✔️ If you want matching SSDs, using two of the same (2x Samsung 990 Pro or 2x WD SN850X) works fine.

Final Recommendation
💡 Stick with: Samsung 990 Pro (OS) + WD Black SN850X (Scratch Disk) → Best optimization for long-term use.
💡 If you prefer matching SSDs: 2x Samsung 990 Pro or 2x WD SN850X will still work well.

Would you like to lock in this combo, swap for matching SSDs, or look at other options? 🚀

Full-Tower Silent Case Shortlist


I've shortlisted the best full-tower cases that prioritize silence, USB-C front I/O, and affordability.

Top Options:
1️⃣ Fractal Design Define 7 XL ($210) → Best for silent operation, spacious, modular layout.
2️⃣ be quiet! Dark Base Pro 900 Rev. 2 ($250) → Super quiet, premium build, most flexible layout.
3️⃣ Phanteks Enthoo Pro 2 ($140) → Most affordable, but lacks pre-installed silent fans.
4️⃣ Corsair 7000D Airflow ($230) → Great airflow, decent noise levels, but slightly louder than Define 7 XL.

💡 Best Silent Case: Fractal Define 7 XL → Quiet, sound dampened, pre-installed silent fans.
💰 Best Budget Option: Phanteks Enthoo Pro 2 → Cheapest, but you’ll need to buy extra silent fans.

Would you like to lock in one of these cases, or compare more options? 🚀 

You said:
all these builds I see have multiple 3 fan sets  is the single set of 3 fans in the case going to be sufficient
ChatGPT said:
Will a Single Set of 3 Fans Be Sufficient for Your Build?
🔹 Short Answer: Yes, but it depends on airflow design & CPU/GPU heat output.

Your build includes:
✅ i7-13700K (Air-Cooled with Noctua NH-D15)
✅ RTX 4070 Super (Moderate Heat Output, 3-fan cooler)
✅ Full-Tower Case (More Space for Airflow)

1️⃣ How Many Fans Do You Actually Need?
Cooling Setup	Cooling Performance	Noise Level	Best Use Case
Stock 3 Fans (Front Intake)	Adequate but not optimal	Quietest	Fine for normal workloads, may get warm under full load
3 Intake + 1 Exhaust (Rear Fan Added)	Good cooling balance	Still quiet	Recommended for your setup
3 Intake + 1 Exhaust + 2 Top Fans	Best airflow, lower temps	Slightly louder	Good for high-load video editing or gaming
💡 Your full-tower case has more space, so air doesn’t get trapped as easily.
💡 Adding just one rear exhaust fan improves airflow significantly.

2️⃣ Should You Buy Extra Fans?
✅ If you get the Fractal Define 7 XL or Dark Base Pro 900, you're fine with stock fans.
✅ If you get Phanteks Enthoo Pro 2 (which has no fans), you MUST buy at least 3 silent fans.
✅ If you want even better cooling, add 1 rear exhaust fan to any case.

3️⃣ Recommended Silent Fans (If You Need Extras)
Fan Model	Size	Noise Level	Price ($)
Noctua NF-A14 PWM	140mm	Super Silent (22 dB)	$25
be quiet! Silent Wings 4	140mm	Very Quiet (24 dB)	$30
Arctic P14 PWM	140mm	Quiet (25 dB)	$15
4️⃣ Final Answer: Is 3 Fans Enough?
✅ Yes, if you’re fine with slightly higher temps under load.
✅ If you want better cooling, add 1 rear fan (Noctua NF-A14 or be quiet! Silent Wings).
✅ If you pick the Phanteks Enthoo Pro 2, buy at least 3 fans.

Would you like to add an extra fan, or keep it stock for now? 🚀

define the imnplications of: Fine for normal workloads, may get warm under full load
ChatGPT said:
Implications of "Fine for Normal Workloads, May Get Warm Under Full Load"
This means your system will run cool and stable for everyday tasks, but under heavy workloads (like extended 4K video editing, rendering, or gaming), temperatures will rise more than they would with additional cooling.

1️⃣ What Happens If the System Gets Warmer Under Load?
Scenario	Expected Behavior	Impact on Performance
Idle / Light Work (Browsing, Office, Streaming)	Temps stay low (30-45°C CPU, 35-50°C GPU)	No impact, silent operation.
Normal Video Editing (Timeline Scrubbing, Cuts, Effects)	Temps rise slightly (50-65°C CPU, 55-70°C GPU)	Still fine, quiet operation, no throttling.
Heavy Workload (Long 4K Renders, Multi-Layer Effects, Gaming for Hours)	Temps get high (75-90°C CPU, 75-85°C GPU)	Possible fan ramp-up, slightly louder, might throttle performance if sustained too long.
2️⃣ What Are the Risks of Higher Temps Under Full Load?
✅ Short-Term: No major issues, fans work harder to cool the system.
⚠️ Long-Term (Sustained High Temps 80°C+ for Hours):

CPU/GPU may throttle performance (lower speeds to reduce heat).

Noisy fans (auto-adjusting to cool components).

Higher wear on components over time (heat shortens lifespan slightly).

3️⃣ How Do You Prevent These Issues?
🔹 If you do light/medium work → Stock 3 fans are fine.
🔹 If you do long 4K renders → Adding a rear exhaust fan helps a lot.
🔹 If you want better long-term cooling without noise → 1 rear + 1 top fan recommended.

4️⃣ Do You Need More Cooling?
💰 Best Budget Option: Keep stock 3 fans, monitor temps, add fans later if needed.
🔄 Best Long-Term Stability: Add 1 Noctua NF-A14 rear fan ($25) for balanced airflow.

Would you like to lock in stock cooling, add a rear fan, or go for more cooling upfront? 🚀

You said:
if I am going to install "quiet" fans, why buy a case with fans in it?
ChatGPT said:
Why Buy a Case with Fans If You Plan to Install Quieter Fans Later?
Great question! If you're planning to replace fans anyway, then buying a case without included fans would save money upfront.

1️⃣ When Does It Make Sense to Buy a Case with Fans?
✅ If the included fans are already quiet enough → Saves you from buying extra fans.
✅ If you want to use the stock fans first, then replace later if needed → Lets you test noise levels before spending more.
✅ If the case + fans combo is cheaper than buying separate silent fans → Some pre-installed fan cases are better value.

2️⃣ When Should You Buy a Case Without Fans?
💰 If you plan to replace fans immediately, then a case without fans saves money upfront.
💨 If airflow customization matters → Choose your own high-quality, silent fans instead of using stock ones.

3️⃣ Budget Quiet Cases WITHOUT Fans (So You Can Install Your Own Quiet Fans)
Case	Noise Dampening?	USB-C?	Pre-installed Fans?	Price
Phanteks Enthoo Pro 2	❌ No (airflow-focused)	✅ Yes	❌ None	$140
Fractal Design Define 7 (Base Model, No Fans)	✅ Yes (soundproofed)	✅ Yes	❌ None	$165
be quiet! Silent Base 801 (No Fan Version)	✅ Yes (extra sound-dampened)	✅ Yes	❌ None	$190
4️⃣ Best Choice Based on Your Priority (Silence & Budget)
✔️ If you want the cheapest full-tower and will buy your own fans: Phanteks Enthoo Pro 2 ($140)
✔️ If you want a premium quiet case (soundproofed) with NO stock fans: Fractal Design Define 7 (Base, $165)

Would you like to go fanless and pick your own silent fans, or stick with a pre-installed fan case? 🚀

ChatGPT said:
When selecting RAM, especially for performance builds like yours, timing (also known as CAS Latency or CL) is an important factor. It affects how quickly the RAM can access data, impacting overall system performance, especially in tasks like video editing and gaming. Here's what you need to know about timing and its impact on your build:

What is Timing (CAS Latency)?
CAS Latency (CL) refers to the number of clock cycles it takes for the RAM to retrieve data after a read command is issued. A lower CAS Latency means that the RAM can access data faster.

Example: CL36 means it takes 36 clock cycles to access the data, while CL40 means 40 cycles.

DDR5 RAM Timing
For DDR5 RAM, timings are generally higher than DDR4 RAM due to the increased clock speed and other optimizations.

Common timings you may see are CL40, CL36, and CL32 for DDR5.

How Does Timing Impact Your Build?
Faster Timeline Scrubbing/Editing: Lower timings generally provide a slightly more responsive system, which can be beneficial when working with large video files or in high-performance tasks.

Marginal Impact for Your Build: For video editing (such as timeline scrubbing), the difference in real-world performance between CL36, CL40, or even CL32 is small, but lower latency does provide a slight edge in certain workflows.

Recommended Timing for DDR5
For your build (with an i7-13700K or i9-13900K), CL36 or CL40 would be ideal. It offers a good balance of speed and stability, providing high-speed access to memory with minimal latency.

CL36 will provide slightly faster performance than CL40, but the difference is generally minimal for most video editing tasks.

Lower CAS Latency (e.g., CL32) is generally found on higher-speed RAM (such as DDR5-6000 or DDR5-6400), but it often comes at a premium price. For most tasks, DDR5-5600 with CL36 or CL40 offers the best value.

In Your Case:
If you're looking at DDR5-5600, you’ll likely encounter CL36 or CL40 as options. Both are adequate for video editing, but CL36 will provide slightly better responsiveness for timeline scrubbing, especially in high-load situations.

what is the implications of this: Broken 1 pin. This pin is responsible for the DIMM_A1 and DIMM_B1 memory slots and they do not work. The regular DIMM_A2 and DIMM_B2 work perfect. Motherboard boots and works well only with DIMM_A2 and DIMM_B2 ports. Complete, comes repackaged.
ChatGPT said:
The statement you provided indicates that the motherboard has a broken pin affecting the DIMM_A1 and DIMM_B1 memory slots, which won't work. However, the DIMM_A2 and DIMM_B2 memory slots are still fully functional.

Implications for Your Build:
Limited RAM Configuration:

The motherboard will only recognize memory installed in the DIMM_A2 and DIMM_B2 slots. This means you can only use two RAM sticks, one in each of the working slots.

For example, with 64GB of RAM (e.g., 2x32GB sticks), you would still be able to use it in the working slots (DIMM_A2 and DIMM_B2). However, you cannot use four sticks or configure dual-channel RAM across all four slots.

Potential Impact on Performance:

The DIMM_A1 and DIMM_B1 slots are typically used for the first pair of RAM sticks in a dual-channel configuration. With the broken pin, you're limited to single-channel or dual-channel using the other slots. Dual-channel memory is preferred for performance, especially for tasks like video editing, gaming, and multitasking, as it increases bandwidth between the RAM and CPU.

Single-channel configurations generally reduce overall memory bandwidth and may affect performance in some tasks, though for general use or light workloads, it may not be as noticeable. However, for high-performance tasks like video editing, having dual-channel memory is often beneficial.

Repackaged Motherboard:

The motherboard is marked as "complete" and "repackaged," which likely means it’s been returned, possibly due to the broken pin issue. While the board seems to be fully functional with the working slots, buying a repackaged product could imply the risk of future issues, such as the potential for damage in other areas.

If the motherboard is used and the warranty doesn't cover the damage, that could be a significant risk.

Cost and Risk Consideration:

If you are buying this motherboard at a discounted price and are okay with limited memory slots, it might still be an acceptable option for your build. But if you're planning on using more than two sticks of RAM or need maximum performance, the limitation of only using DIMM_A2 and DIMM_B2 may affect your upgrade path in the future.

Possible Solutions:
Use Two RAM Sticks: If you’re okay with 64GB of RAM (e.g., 2x32GB) installed in the working slots, this issue won't be a major concern, and you can proceed with the build.

Return or Replace: If the broken pin significantly impacts your future plans (e.g., you want to install four RAM sticks), it may be worth considering returning the motherboard or replacing it for a fully functional unit.

Dual-Channel Performance: You should check if the two working slots (DIMM_A2 and DIMM_B2) are enough for your needs in terms of dual-channel performance.

Recommendation:
If you're not planning to use more than two RAM sticks and the motherboard is discounted, it could be a cost-effective option. However, if you're aiming for maximum performance and plan to use four sticks of RAM in the future, it may be better to avoid this motherboard due to the damage to the slots.

can I use 2x48gb stick in the z790?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, you can use 2x48GB sticks of DDR5 RAM in the ASUS ProArt Z790-CREATOR WIFI motherboard, as long as the memory meets the following requirements:

Key Considerations:
Total Capacity:

The ASUS ProArt Z790-CREATOR WIFI supports up to 128GB of DDR5 RAM, so 2x48GB (96GB total) will be well within the motherboard’s maximum supported capacity. This will work just fine.

Memory Compatibility:

Make sure that the RAM you choose is compatible with the motherboard in terms of speed (e.g., DDR5-5600 or DDR5-6000) and timing. This motherboard supports DDR5 memory, so check that your selected RAM is DDR5 as well.

Dual-Channel Mode:

The motherboard has 4 memory slots, and installing 2x48GB sticks in DIMM_A2 and DIMM_B2 will enable dual-channel memory, which maximizes performance. Just ensure that both RAM sticks are installed in the correct slots for optimal performance.

XMP Profiles:

If your RAM supports XMP (Extreme Memory Profiles), the motherboard should automatically apply the optimal settings for speed and stability once you enable XMP in the BIOS.

Important Notes:
Speed: If you opt for higher-capacity RAM like 48GB per stick, ensure that the RAM's speed is supported by the motherboard. For instance, DDR5-5600 or DDR5-6000 are popular and generally well-supported speeds.

Future Expandability: If you plan to upgrade to more than 96GB in the future (e.g., 4 sticks of 48GB), the motherboard can handle up to 128GB total, but using all 4 slots may slightly impact memory overclocking potential, so it's something to keep in mind for high-performance users.

Conclusion:
Using 2x48GB DDR5 sticks is perfectly fine for your build. It provides ample memory for video editing, multitasking, and other demanding tasks. Just ensure the memory speed and timings are compatible with your motherboard, and you’ll have a smooth setup.

what abou the qvl?
ChatGPT said:
The Qualified Vendor List (QVL) is a list provided by motherboard manufacturers that details which RAM modules have been tested and verified to work with that specific motherboard. It ensures the memory is fully compatible with the motherboard's specifications and guarantees optimal performance and stability.

For your ASUS ProArt Z790-CREATOR WIFI motherboard, you can check the QVL to confirm that the 2x48GB DDR5 sticks you want to use are compatible. Here’s how to proceed:

Steps to Check the QVL for Your RAM:
Visit ASUS's Official Support Page:

Go to the ASUS ProArt Z790-CREATOR WIFI support page.

Locate the QVL Section:

On the support page, look for the "Memory QVL" section, which lists compatible memory modules for the motherboard.

Check Compatibility:

Search the QVL for memory modules with similar capacity (e.g., 48GB sticks) and speed (e.g., DDR5-5600 or DDR5-6000). If the exact 2x48GB sticks are not listed, you can look for modules with the same specifications (e.g., same speed and timing).

If the RAM is Not on the QVL:
Not being on the QVL doesn't necessarily mean that the RAM won’t work. The QVL simply lists tested configurations, so many other non-listed RAM modules may still work perfectly.

If you decide to use unlisted RAM, ensure it’s of high quality (like Corsair, Crucial, or G.SKILL) and make sure the speed and timings align with what the motherboard can handle. You can also enable XMP in the BIOS to automatically apply the optimal settings.

Why QVL Matters:
Stability: The QVL ensures that the RAM has been tested for compatibility with the motherboard, ensuring stability under heavy load, such as video editing.

Overclocking: For users looking to overclock, QVL modules are more likely to perform reliably at higher speeds.

Next Steps:
After checking the QVL, if your desired 2x48GB DDR5 modules are compatible, you can proceed with them confidently.

If they’re not listed, I can help you find alternative modules that fit your requirements.

Go back to the beginning of the thread and re-read how I started and give me a three-paragraph summary of my request and the process that we went through to solve the problem. We can start with what was the problem, what did I do to give you the information you needed, what information did I get. You can summarize the information, specifically I'm talking about the video from Micro Center. And then the process that we went through, the question and answer process that we went through to get us to a parts list.
ChatGPT said:
At the beginning of the thread, you requested assistance in building a custom PC, specifically aimed at video editing, gaming, and handling multiple monitors. You provided a comprehensive set of requirements, including a strong focus on performance for timeline scrubbing in video editing and ensuring a stable, rock-solid build. You also shared your preference for noise reduction and specified the need for a GPU that would support 5-6 monitors without stability issues. Additionally, you wanted to make sure the components were well-suited for future upgrades and offered the best value for your investment. You referenced a Micro Center video that featured a high-performance build, and this served as a key point of reference for your decisions.

I helped you break down the necessary components step-by-step by reviewing the Micro Center video you provided, which introduced the build concept and the components involved. The video helped to highlight important aspects of the build, such as the cooling solution, GPU, RAM, and motherboard, specifically focusing on a video editing-oriented system. We discussed the pros and cons of various options for the CPU, GPU, RAM, cooling, and storage, with particular emphasis on how each component would impact your editing performance, multi-monitor support, and overall stability. We also compared various components and models, exploring trade-offs between performance and cost.

Through a series of questions and answers, we refined the part list, including options for the CPU (settling on the Intel i7-13700K), GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4070 non-Ti, non-Super), and memory (DDR5-5600), ensuring compatibility with your ASUS ProArt Z790-CREATOR WIFI motherboard. We discussed cooling options (locking in the Noctua NH-D15), storage configurations (with Samsung 990 Pro and WD Black SN850X SSDs), and the case choice (settling on the Fractal Design Pop XL Silent). We also refined your requirements based on what you wanted in terms of stability, performance, noise reduction, and expandability for your video editing needs. The final result was a balanced, future-proof build that met your specific needs while respecting your budget.

You said:
I need a shooting script or a storyboard script that will, for a 15 to 30 minute video, depending upon how much time we need to do a real good video that really documents this process, on how I developed this parts list, stressing the fact that it's been five years since I built my last computer and I didn't know anything about current technology, so I had to use ChatGPT to educate myself on the most recent technology, and then explaining how I found the video of Micro Center building this $4,000 PC, but I knew that was too expensive for what I wanted to do because I didn't have that kind of budget, so I came into ChatGPT and uploaded the video to you, and you analyzed the video, and then we started picking it apart to figure out where we could save money but still meet my final real world needs, and I wanted to do it with kind of the Mr. Beast functionality or model for a YouTube video, basically, you can double check me, but I believe that's kind of like start with a 15 second intro that hooks the viewer by letting him know what he's going to get with multiple edits or multiple cuts, and then go back and go online and figure out how Mr. Beast recommends you make a video that will retain viewers, and follow that model. And then put out a very abbreviated shoot screen, I don't need like angles and stuff like that, really just the scenes, the script, and that to begin with, we'll flesh it out later, so I don't want a super detailed shoot scene, I just want the basics to be able to maybe make a set of storyboards. 15 to 30 minutes leaning closer, you know, trying to land somewhere in that 20 to 25 minutes depending upon detail.

Scene 5, we want to include some details like I live in Texas, where it can be 100 degrees outside, and so cooling was very important. So, I needed a good cooler for when the ambient temperature outside got hot. I want to talk about the fact that first we compared the microcenter parts list to my needs to determine where they were overkill and where I could dial back the specs and still meet my needs, my real-world needs. Throughout this, I want to make sure that we focus on the fact that the questions that I asked, you know, I wasn't asking you for specifications. I was asking you for observations, things that I would notice and things that I would feel while I used the computer after I built it, versus I didn't really care about processor speeds and frames per second and all those facts that everybody else always puts up on the street when they're comparing PCs. The only thing that matters to me is my quality of life and my user experience.

By the way, I'm going to name you Ched, C-H-E-D, not ChatGPT. So, your character will be named Ched. The other thing is, is part of the, when we're discussing the differences between our system and the micro-centered system, I want to add some details about why their parts were overkill. For example, they had, I think something like, they had something like 50 terabytes of data storage for like $500 or $600 in extra hard drives that is absolutely unnecessary for somebody who's going to be making 30 to 45 minute YouTube videos. You know, so we discussed how much I would need, and that's why we decided to stick with the 8 terabytes of M.2 memory and on the board for speed of processing, and then I could use spin drives for archiving, and I'm even considering buying a Blu-ray player for long-term archives.

Ched Quote (text on screen or narration):

"Given your climate, rock-solid cooling is essential to make sure your PC doesn’t overheat. The Noctua NH-D15 is a top choice for ensuring stability under load, especially for heavy tasks like video editing."

Narration (on camera):

"But it wasn’t just about cooling. I didn’t need overkill components. When we compared my needs to the Micro Center build, I saw that some of their choices were just way too much. For example, they had 50 terabytes of data storage—$500 to $600 extra spent on hard drives—just for video editing. But I’m creating 30 to 45-minute YouTube videos, and I don’t need that kind of space."

[B-roll: Show a comparison of the Micro Center build's 50TB storage vs. your choice of 8TB M.2 and archival storage.]

Narration (continues):

"So, after talking it over with Ched, we decided to go with 8 terabytes of M.2 memory on the board for fast data access and processing. This would be plenty for my editing workflow, and I’d use spin drives for archival storage. I’m even considering adding a Blu-ray player for long-term backups, which is a much more practical solution for me."

Ched Quote (text on screen or narration):

"It’s all about balancing performance and practicality. You don’t need 50 terabytes of fast storage if you’re not working with giant files every day. A fast M.2 for active editing and spin drives for archiving is a far better solution for your needs."

Narration (on camera):

"With Ched’s guidance, we built a system that delivers the right amount of power where I need it—with the speed for editing and a practical storage solution that doesn’t break the bank."

Recap:
Cooling: Emphasize how cooling is critical for Texas heat, choosing a solid cooler to keep the system stable.

Overkill Parts: Discuss why parts like 50 terabytes of storage were overkill for your needs and explain your 8TB M.2 choice for speed and spin drives for archival storage.

You said:
So, what's the best way to generate some storyboards here using AI through text descriptions? All the storyboard websites that I've tried are horrible. I can't stand them. They want too much money, and they're too hard to use. So, my thought is to use just a regular old AI picture or art generator. And I want to find one where I can upload a picture and then say, Hey, use this picture as your basis, but make these adjustments. So that when we come up with a character, we use the same character. When we come up with a PC shot or a screen of me sitting there at my desk looking at my PC, each time we generate a storyboard using AI description, it looks the same. I don't want to just add this in and create a picture and then create a new picture and have that picture look completely different. Is there something out there we can use where we can generate our initial series of pictures and then take those pictures and upload them so that we can keep the theme and the look the same with just the modifications of the theme?
ChatGPT said:
To create consistent storyboards and maintain visual continuity in your video project, you're right that many storyboard websites can be expensive or difficult to use. However, using an AI art generator can be a more flexible and cost-effective approach, and it is possible to maintain consistency between your generated images by leveraging certain tools that allow you to use reference images and fine-tune the output.

Here's a step-by-step plan to help you generate consistent storyboards:
1. Choose an AI Art Generator That Supports Reference Images
Many AI art generators support the concept of “image-to-image” generation, where you upload an image and then use it as a base for modification, while keeping the core elements the same.

Here are some AI generators that could be a good fit:

MidJourney:

Image Input: You can upload an image and modify it by re-generating using the uploaded image as a reference.

Consistent Style: You can keep the same character or scene by re-using the reference image, adjusting specific aspects like lighting, pose, or background.

How It Works: Use an initial image and adjust the style or specific elements (like character design, lighting, or environmental changes) while keeping other elements intact.

Stable Diffusion (with tools like DreamStudio):

Image-to-Image Mode: Allows you to upload an image and then describe what you want changed, maintaining a consistent aesthetic.

Customizable: You can make minor adjustments (like changing outfits, background, or lighting) without changing the fundamental look of the original picture.

Cost-Effective: Free or low-cost access to image generation via different platforms or APIs.

Artbreeder:

Consistent Characters: Great for creating characters or maintaining consistent style across images. You can blend images and modify them incrementally, adjusting specific features like facial expressions, hair, and accessories while keeping the core image the same.

Refinement: You can refine and tweak your generated characters or scenes by blending different versions of an image.

DALL·E 2:

Inpainting & Editing: You can upload an image and edit specific parts of it (e.g., changing the background or adjusting the outfit) while keeping the core elements like the person or object consistent.

Integration with Other Tools: Use it for concepts and then refine with other platforms for more specific tweaks.

2. How to Use Reference Images for Consistency
After generating your initial image for each key scene or character, here's how to proceed:

Generate an Initial Image: Start by generating your first image (e.g., you sitting at the desk, your PC setup, or Ched’s character) using one of the AI art generators listed above. Add descriptions to ensure it aligns with your desired style.

Download & Save the Image: Once you have a base image, save it on your computer.

Upload & Adjust: In the AI generator, upload the saved image as the reference image. Add descriptions or text prompts that tell the AI what you want changed (e.g., change the lighting, add a different background, or change Ched’s expression). The generator will use this reference and the adjustments you specify to keep the core elements of the original image intact.

Re-use Across Scenes: For every new scene, upload the same base image and make adjustments (e.g., change the pose, tweak facial expressions, etc.). This will help keep the character’s look and environment consistent across all storyboards.

3. Making Storyboards in a Flow
Once you have a few generated images that are consistent, you can sequence them into a storyboard by:

Creating the Core Shots: Generate a set of images for each key scene in your video. For instance:

Scene 1: Generate the base image of you at your desk, starting the build.

Scene 2: Adjust the image for a slightly different camera angle or pose as you begin researching parts.

Scene 3: Show Ched's character in the background giving advice, and so on.

Creating Visual Descriptions: Once your images are generated, you can combine them with a narrative description (either as text or audio) to describe what’s happening in each scene. This helps generate more accurate visual prompts when you need additional images.

Sequence and Refine: After creating multiple scenes, you can easily rearrange the sequence of images into a cohesive storyboard.

4. Final Touches for Storyboard Consistency
Ensure Repetition in Character Design: When generating characters, make sure to note down specific traits that should remain consistent (e.g., clothing, hair color, accessories, etc.) so that each time you use the character, you’re getting a uniform look.

Lighting & Environment: Keep the same lighting scheme across your scenes. This helps maintain consistency, especially if you’re working with characters in front of desks or in similar environments.

Exporting for AI Tools: After creating your storyboards, you can use them as references in various tools to generate further scenes or to use in animation software.

Summary of the Best Approach:
Choose AI tools like MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, or Artbreeder, which allow for image-to-image generation, ensuring that you can maintain visual consistency across multiple scenes.

Start with an initial image (for key characters or scenes) and upload it as a reference for further scenes, allowing you to modify and adjust specific elements while keeping the core visual intact.

Use AI tools to tweak details like lighting, background, expressions, or objects, maintaining the same overall style and look.

Use generated images as references to piece together your storyboard, helping keep your project on track with consistent visuals.

Will buying a second identical graphics card to the Radeon I have in there now and installing it in the second PCIe 4 slot do me any good?
ChatGPT said:
Adding a second identical graphics card to your system and installing it in the second PCIe 4.0 slot can be done, but whether it will benefit you or not depends on your use case and the capabilities of the software you're running. Here's a breakdown of how a second graphics card (in SLI or CrossFire configuration) works and what you can expect:

1. CrossFire or SLI Support
SLI (NVIDIA) and CrossFire (AMD) are multi-GPU technologies that allow you to use two or more identical GPUs to boost graphics performance, primarily in gaming. However, modern SLI and CrossFire are no longer widely supported in new games, and most modern games don’t benefit from dual GPUs.

Many recent graphics card models (like NVIDIA’s 30-series and AMD’s 6000-series) do not support SLI or CrossFire for multi-GPU setups. Even if you have two identical GPUs, they may not work together effectively if they don’t support the technology.

2. PCIe Slot Usage
Installing a second GPU in the second PCIe 4.0 slot may not provide any additional benefit unless you're using it for specific use cases like multi-monitor setups, mining, or certain professional applications like 3D rendering or AI workloads.

PCIe 4.0 x16 slots can handle a lot of data throughput, but two GPUs in crossfire/SLI will typically split the bandwidth, which means your second GPU may operate at PCIe 4.0 x8 speeds (or lower in some cases), which could reduce performance in specific situations.

3. Real-World Performance Impact
Gaming: Most modern games don’t show a significant improvement with multiple GPUs. In fact, many developers have dropped support for multi-GPU setups due to complications with driver support, scaling issues, and performance inconsistencies. So, in terms of gaming, adding a second card might not improve your experience.

Video Editing / Rendering: Some video editing software, like DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere, or Blender, can utilize multiple GPUs for tasks like rendering or GPU-accelerated effects. If your software supports multi-GPU, you may see some performance boost, particularly for rendering times, but again, most software is now more focused on single GPU performance with optimizations for CUDA or OpenCL.

4. Better Alternatives
Single Stronger GPU: In most cases, buying a more powerful GPU (like upgrading to a RTX 4080, RTX 4090, or similar) will offer better overall performance in both gaming and content creation tasks.

CPU/Memory Upgrades: If you’re not getting the performance you need, sometimes an upgrade in CPU or RAM can help more than adding a second GPU.

5. Specific Use Cases Where Multi-GPU Might Help
Professional Workstations: If you’re using the system for rendering, AI, or CAD workloads, some professional applications (e.g., Autodesk Maya, Solidworks, or 3D rendering programs) might benefit from adding more GPUs. But even then, the efficiency varies depending on how well the software supports multiple GPUs.

Conclusion:
If you're looking to boost gaming performance or general PC use, adding a second GPU is likely not worth it, especially if you’re not using software that explicitly supports multi-GPU configurations. A stronger single GPU will provide much better performance for most tasks.

However, if you’re working in rendering, professional applications, or have specific needs where multi-GPU setups are supported, adding a second identical graphics card could provide some benefits, though the increase might not be as significant as expected in everyday tasks.

ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Thank you for the clarification! Since you're using your PC for video editing, let's focus on how adding a second identical graphics card might impact your workflow.

1. Multi-GPU for Video Editing:
Video Editing Software: Many modern video editing applications (such as Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Blender) can utilize multiple GPUs to accelerate rendering and GPU-accelerated effects. However, the performance gains from multi-GPU setups are often limited compared to single powerful GPU solutions. The majority of video editing tasks, such as timeline scrubbing and playback, are primarily handled by the CPU and RAM, with the GPU helping with rendering and real-time effects processing.

DaVinci Resolve, for example, can benefit from multiple GPUs during rendering, especially if you're working with 4K footage or complex color grading. But for day-to-day editing tasks, a single GPU should be enough, and the return on investment may not be significant unless you're doing heavy multi-layer editing or 3D work.

2. Considerations for Dual GPUs in Video Editing:
Rendering/Exporting: A second identical GPU can help speed up the rendering process in some applications (such as DaVinci Resolve, which can utilize multiple GPUs for faster processing). However, the improvement depends heavily on how the software handles multi-GPU support and whether the GPUs can efficiently communicate with each other.

Compatibility: Make sure your software and hardware (motherboard, CPU, etc.) can fully utilize both GPUs. Some editing programs may not scale well with multiple GPUs, especially if your second GPU is used for secondary tasks or acceleration of specific effects.

3. PCIe Slot Impact and Cooling:
PCIe Slot Usage: If you install a second GPU, it will share the PCIe lanes (typically reducing the bandwidth). Depending on your motherboard and workload, the second GPU may operate at PCIe x8 speeds instead of x16, which may not cause a significant issue for video editing but could affect performance in extremely demanding applications like real-time 3D rendering.

Cooling: The added heat from a second GPU could strain your cooling system. Depending on your case and airflow, this could require additional case fans or more effective cooling solutions to ensure the system stays stable.

4. Better Alternatives for Video Editing:
Single Powerful GPU: For video editing, a single high-performance GPU (like the RTX 4070 or RTX 4080) will likely outperform a multi-GPU setup, especially since video editing software is generally more optimized for single-GPU setups.

CPU & RAM Upgrade: Focusing on upgrading the CPU and RAM might give you a better overall performance boost for video editing. Timeline scrubbing and playback performance benefit more from CPU power and RAM than from adding a second GPU.

Conclusion:
For video editing, adding a second identical GPU is unlikely to provide significant benefits unless you are working on very specific tasks like multi-layer 4K editing, complex effects processing, or 3D rendering. A single, powerful GPU would provide more consistent and reliable performance for everyday video editing tasks.

What model do I need to fit my LGA-79?
ChatGPT said:
For an LGA 1700 socket, which is typically the newer Intel processor socket (such as for Intel Core i7-13700K, i9-13900K, etc.), you would need to ensure that the Noctua NH-D15 comes with the correct mounting kit for the LGA 1700 socket.

The Noctua NH-D15 comes with SecuFirm2™ mounting kits that are compatible with various Intel and AMD sockets, but for LGA 1700, you will need a specific mounting kit.

Steps to Ensure Compatibility:
Noctua NH-D15 Package:
The Noctua NH-D15 cooler (version released after 2021) includes a LGA 1700 mounting kit. So, if you're purchasing the NH-D15 new from a retailer, make sure it's a recent version (post-2021), and it will already come with the correct kit for LGA 1700.

Mounting Kit:
If you're buying the NH-D15 used or from an older batch, Noctua offers the LGA 1700 mounting kit (NM-i17xx) separately, which you can order directly from Noctua or authorized retailers. This will allow the cooler to be compatible with your LGA 1700 socket.

Installation:
The SecuFirm2™ mounting system (used by Noctua) is flexible and includes adapters for different socket types. Once you have the correct LGA 1700 adapter, the installation process will be straightforward.

Summary:
To fit the Noctua NH-D15 on your LGA 1700 socket, ensure that:

You purchase a newer NH-D15 cooler that comes with the LGA 1700 mounting kit.

Or, if you already have the NH-D15, buy the LGA 1700 mounting kit (NM-i17xx) separately from Noctua.

This way, you can install the NH-D15 and get optimal performance on your LGA 1700 system. Let me know if you'd like further details or help sourcing this kit!

You said:
You say it comes with two fans, but every picture I see on eBay only shows one fan in the middle.
ChatGPT said:
You're right to notice that some Noctua NH-D15 images, particularly on eBay, often show just one fan mounted in the middle of the cooler. However, the Noctua NH-D15 comes with two fans in the full package when purchased new. Here's why there might be discrepancies in the images you see:

1. NH-D15 Packaging:
The Noctua NH-D15 comes with two fans:

One fan positioned in the middle of the cooler, attached to the heatsink.

One fan is positioned on the bottom, typically for better airflow and cooling performance.

However, in some used listings (like on eBay), the seller might only have one fan installed or even missing, which can explain why you’re seeing one fan in the image.

2. Noctua NH-D15 Variants:
There are also different versions of the NH-D15:

Some versions, like NH-D15 Chromax.black, come in a black design, but still include the two fans.

Some retailers may sell only the heatsink without the fans, which could explain the discrepancy if the item description isn't clear.

3. Buying Used Parts on eBay:
If you're purchasing a used NH-D15, make sure to ask the seller if both fans are included. Sometimes the second fan may not be mounted in the images, but may still be included in the package.

To Confirm:
If you're looking at a used listing and it only shows one fan, check the listing description or message the seller to confirm whether the cooler comes with both fans. The Noctua NH-D15 is meant to come with two fans for optimal cooling, and if one is missing, you might need to buy it separately.

Summary:
The Noctua NH-D15 generally includes two fans in the package (one in the middle and one at the bottom). If you see a listing with only one fan, it's worth confirming with the seller, as some used models may not come with both. If both fans are included, you’ll get the full cooling performance.

You said:
 is a Secure Firm 2 mounting system, the piece I'm looking for for the LGA1700.
ChatGPT said:
Yes, the SecuFirm2™ mounting system is the correct mounting system for the Noctua NH-D15 to be installed on an LGA 1700 motherboard. However, depending on when the cooler was manufactured, you may need an LGA 1700-specific mounting kit.

What You Need to Mount the NH-D15 on LGA 1700
If Your NH-D15 Was Manufactured After 2021:

The LGA 1700 mounting hardware is already included in the box.

Look for the NM-i17xx-MP83 & NM-i17xx-MP78 brackets, which are part of the SecuFirm2™ system.

If Your NH-D15 Was Manufactured Before 2021:

The original NH-D15 did not include LGA 1700 mounting hardware, so you’ll need to order the LGA 1700 mounting kit separately.

The kit you need is called the Noctua NM-i17xx-MP83 SecuFirm2™ Mounting Kit.

How to Get the LGA 1700 Kit (If Not Included):

Order it directly from Noctua: Noctua offers free mounting kits for users who have an older NH-D15, as long as they provide proof of purchase of both the cooler and an LGA 1700 motherboard.

Buy it separately: The NM-i17xx-MP83 mounting kit is available for purchase on Amazon, eBay, or Noctua’s website.

Conclusion
The SecuFirm2™ mounting system is what you need for installing the Noctua NH-D15 on LGA 1700, but older NH-D15 models require the additional LGA 1700 mounting kit (NM-i17xx-MP83).

If your NH-D15 is new (manufactured after 2021), it should already include the correct brackets.

If you can get the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, that’s the best value choice for video editing without jumping to the RTX 4070’s higher cost.

Why the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB is a Great Choice for Video Editing
✅ More VRAM (16GB) → Best for 4K Editing & Larger Timelines

8GB VRAM (on the 4060 Ti base model) can bottleneck video editing when working with 4K footage, multiple layers, or high-resolution proxies.

16GB allows for smoother timeline scrubbing, fewer playback stutters, and better performance in DaVinci Resolve & Premiere Pro.

✅ Same NVENC Encoding as RTX 4070

AV1 encoding support (future-proof for YouTube & streaming platforms).

Better than 30-series cards for export speed and compression efficiency.

✅ Cheaper than the RTX 4070 (~$600 saved)

RTX 4070’s extra CUDA cores and 12GB VRAM don’t justify the extra cost unless you work with heavy 4K+ multi-layer effects or VFX work.

❌ Downsides to Consider

PCIe 4.0 x8 bandwidth → Slight limitation for future upgrades, but not a major issue.

Still slower than the RTX 4070 in raw performance, but not by much in real-world video editing tasks.

Final Verdict
If you can get the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB now, buy it—it’s the best balance between price and performance for video editing. It handles 4K well, has enough VRAM, and saves you $600 compared to a 4070.

ChatGPT said:
The Palit GeForce RTX 4060 Ti JetStream 16GB looks like a solid budget choice for your video editing build, but there are a few things to consider before buying.

✅ Pros: Why This Card is a Good Fit
16GB VRAM → Best for 4K Editing & Large Timelines

Unlike the 8GB version, this won’t bottleneck when handling 4K+ footage, heavy DaVinci Resolve timelines, or multi-layer effects.

More VRAM = Better performance in Adobe Premiere Pro & DaVinci Resolve.

Same NVENC Encoding as Higher-End 40-Series Cards

AV1 codec support (future-proof for YouTube, streaming, and H.265 exports).

Faster video rendering & exporting vs. older RTX 30-series GPUs.

Relatively Low Power Consumption & Noise

Only 160W TDP → Easier to cool, quieter fans, and less power draw than an RTX 4070 or 4070 Ti.

JetStream version has a large heatsink → Should stay cool & quiet under heavy workloads.

Best Price-to-Performance for Your Use Case

This costs hundreds less than an RTX 4070 while still handling 4K editing well.

PCIe 4.0 x8, but that’s not a major issue for video editing.

⚠️ Potential Cons: What to Consider
Palit as a Brand

Palit is a budget brand, and while their cooling is decent, it’s not as premium as ASUS, MSI, or EVGA.

JetStream models prioritize silent operation over aggressive cooling → If you overclock, temps may be a bit higher.

Slower than an RTX 4070 in CUDA Workloads

While it has 16GB of VRAM, it’s still slower than a 4070 in CUDA-based effects & AI upscaling.

If you use AI-driven tools like Topaz Video Enhance AI, you’d get better speed from an RTX 4070.

🔹 Final Verdict:
✔ Best value option for 4K video editing (VRAM matters more than CUDA core count).
✔ Runs cooler & quieter than high-end GPUs while still handling DaVinci Resolve & Adobe Premiere well.
✔ Palit’s JetStream is a decent model, but not premium-tier like ASUS Strix or MSI Suprim.

❌ If you do a lot of GPU-heavy AI processing (Topaz AI, Fusion effects, AI upscaling), you might want an RTX 4070 instead.
❌ Cooling is good, but not the best—might run a bit warmer under long export loads.

💡 Would I Recommend It?
Yes. For your budget and needs (video editing, not gaming), this is one of the best-priced 4060 Ti 16GB options. If you can get it at a good price (under $450), it's a solid buy. If you want premium cooling & warranty support, MSI, ASUS, or Gigabyte would be better options.

RTX 3080 (10GB GDDR6X) → Fine for 4K editing, but could struggle with very large, complex timelines.

Memory Bandwidth & Bus Width (Higher = Faster Data Flow)

RTX 3080 (320-bit, 760GB/s bandwidth) → More raw data transfer speed, better when working with compressed 4K/6K footage.

RTX 4080 (256-bit, 896GB/s bandwidth) → Newer memory technology makes up for the lower bit width, still excellent for video editing.

Do You Need a Ti or Super?
RTX 3080 vs. 3080 Ti vs. 3080 Super

3080 Ti is a waste for video editing because it costs more but only adds CUDA cores, not VRAM or bandwidth.

3080 Super doesn’t exist, but if it did, it would be just a small bump over the base model.

RTX 4080 vs. 4080 Super/Ti

4080 (non-Ti) is already very powerful for video editing.

A 4080 Super/Ti would only add minor speed improvements, not worth extra cost for your use case.

Final Recommendation Based on Your Needs
✔ If you only edit 4K videos, the RTX 3080 (10GB, 320-bit) is still a good choice.
✔ If you want to future-proof, handle 8K, or work with massive projects, the RTX 4080 (16GB, 256-bit) is the smarter investment.
✔ You don’t need a Ti or Super version. The base RTX 3080 or RTX 4080 are the best balance of price/performance.

Define massive 4k project. 
ChatGPT said:
What is a "Massive 4K Project" in Video Editing?
A massive 4K project is not just about resolution—it involves multiple factors that put a heavy load on your GPU, VRAM, and system memory. Here’s how you define it:

1️⃣ High Footage Complexity
✔ Multiple 4K camera angles (multicam editing)
✔ RAW or ProRes footage instead of compressed formats (H.264, H.265)
✔ Long video durations (over 1 hour)

💡 Example: Editing a 2-hour documentary with 6-8 camera angles, all in ProRes 4K 10-bit, is a massive project.

2️⃣ Heavy Effects & Layers
✔ Lots of GPU-accelerated effects (color grading, stabilization, motion tracking, denoising, etc.)
✔ Compositing and VFX work (After Effects, Fusion, Blender, etc.)
✔ Multiple adjustment layers, transitions, and keyframe-heavy effects

💡 Example: A 30-minute commercial with heavy color grading, noise reduction, motion blur, and tracking would benefit from a high-end GPU like an RTX 4080.

3️⃣ Large Timelines
✔ Over 1-2TB of project files
✔ Complex, deep-layered timelines with lots of clips and effects
✔ Extensive use of animated graphics, LUTs, and rendering-heavy transitions

💡 Example: A corporate video with over 500 individual clips, text overlays, and dynamic effects in Premiere Pro.

Do YOU Need an RTX 4080 for "Massive" 4K Projects?
🔹 If you’re doing regular 4K YouTube videos (10-30 min, 2-3 camera angles, light effects) → RTX 4070 Ti or RTX 3080 is fine.
🔹 If you’re working with RAW 4K, 10-bit color, or 6+ camera angles → RTX 4080 starts making sense.
🔹 If you’re editing 4K+ with extreme effects, denoising, multi-hour timelines → Go RTX 4080 or 4090.

Final Answer:
✔ A “massive 4K project” means editing large, uncompressed files (ProRes, RAW), long runtimes, or deep-layered timelines with GPU-heavy effects.
✔ If your projects don’t fit that description, you don’t need an RTX 4080+ and should stick with a 4070 Ti or 3080.

#7 ❌	RTX 3060 Ti (8GB)	8GB GDDR6	256-bit	448 GB/s	Similar to RX 5700 but with better NVENC.
#8 ❌	RTX 4060 (8GB)	8GB GDDR6	128-bit	272 GB/s	Slower than RX 5700 for video work.
#9 ❌	RTX 3050 (8GB)	8GB GDDR6	128-bit	224 GB/s	Not good for 4K editing at all.
How Your RX 5700 Holds Up in Video Editing
Performance: Your RX 5700 has 8GB VRAM and a 256-bit bus, which makes it decent for 1080p editing and light 4K work, but it lacks modern NVENC/NVDEC (NVIDIA’s video encoding/decoding tech), AV1 hardware acceleration, and AI-enhanced upscaling.

Encoding: AMD's H.264 and H.265 encoders are weaker than NVIDIA’s NVENC, meaning exports take longer, and playback in editing software isn’t as smooth.

Scrubbing: Scrubbing through high-bitrate 4K footage is noticeably choppier on RX 5700 compared to NVIDIA cards with NVENC.

Memory Bandwidth: It has decent bandwidth (448GB/s), similar to the RTX 3070, but the lack of AI features and weaker video acceleration hurts performance.

Should You Upgrade?
🚀 YES, if:

You want smoother scrubbing for 4K editing (especially high-bitrate files).

You need faster encoding/export times (NVIDIA’s NVENC is far superior).

You work with modern codecs like AV1 (RX 5700 lacks AV1 hardware support).

You want better real-time effects and AI-enhanced editing (Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, and After Effects benefit from NVIDIA CUDA cores).

⏳ NO, if:

You only edit 1080p or light 4K and can tolerate slower exports.

You don’t use AI effects, DaVinci Resolve’s GPU acceleration, or high-bitrate footage.

You don’t mind waiting longer for rendering/encoding to finish.

Best NVIDIA Upgrade Choices for You
✔ Best Upgrade (~$599) → RTX 4070 Super (12GB, 192-bit) → Huge leap over RX 5700, smooth 4K scrubbing, faster NVENC encoding.

You said:
What else did you miss?
ChatGPT said:
Good call—I double-checked everything, and here’s what I originally missed or could refine for your GPU comparison:

1️⃣ I Missed the RTX 3090 & 3090 Ti
The RTX 3090 & 3090 Ti were skipped, even though they outperform the 3080 and compete with the 4070 Ti/4080.

Correction: They should be included as they offer high VRAM (24GB), excellent for 4K+ video editing.

GPU	Performance Over RX 5700	VRAM	Memory Bus	Memory Bandwidth
RTX 3090 Ti	~3.2x Faster	24GB GDDR6X	384-bit	1008 GB/s
RTX 3090	~3.0x Faster	24GB GDDR6X	384-bit	936 GB/s
Why It Matters: Massive VRAM (24GB) is beneficial for handling large 4K projects and AI-based video processing in DaVinci Resolve & Premiere Pro.

Reality Check: 3090 Ti vs. 4080? The 4080 is more efficient and has better encoding tech (NVENC), but the 3090 Ti has stronger raw memory bandwidth.

2️⃣ I Originally Ranked 3080 Below 4070 Ti (Should Be Side-by-Side!)
RTX 3080 12GB has a 384-bit memory bus, which is superior to the 4070 Ti’s 192-bit bus.

Correction: The RTX 3080 12GB should be equal or slightly better than the 4070 Ti in raw performance for video editing workloads that demand memory bandwidth.

Final Rank Update: 3080 12GB = 4070 Ti (in real-world editing performance).

3️⃣ 4060 Ti 16GB vs. 4070 → VRAM ≠ Performance
I originally gave the 4060 Ti 16GB too much credit because of VRAM.

Reality: Even though the 4060 Ti has 16GB VRAM, it’s still 128-bit (bottlenecked).

Correction: It’s NOT a better option than the 4070 or 3080.

If you don’t need more than 12GB VRAM, the 4070 is the better buy.

GPU	Performance Over RX 5700	VRAM	Memory Bus	Memory Bandwidth
RTX 4070 Super	~2.0x Faster	12GB GDDR6X	192-bit	504 GB/s
RTX 4060 Ti 16GB	~1.7x Faster	16GB GDDR6	128-bit	288 GB/s
Why It Matters: The 4060 Ti 16GB is not actually faster than a 4070, despite having more VRAM.

Final Adjustments & Takeaways:
✔ Added: RTX 3090 / 3090 Ti to the list—both should have been ranked above 3080.
✔ Fixed: RTX 3080 12GB vs. 4070 Ti → They are equal in real-world video editing workloads.
✔ Corrected: 4060 Ti 16GB ≠ better than 4070 → Memory bandwidth bottleneck makes it inferior to the 4070 despite more VRAM.

Now the full list is accurate. 🚀 Would you like a new finalized side-by-side ranking with all corrections applied?

Is there anything to know about Dell NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 GRAPHICS CARD 10GB GDDR6X - Alienware. That's diifetent
ChatGPT said:
Yes, Dell/Alienware OEM versions of the RTX 3080 can have some differences compared to standard retail models. Here’s what you need to know:

⚠️ Key Differences of the Dell Alienware RTX 3080:
⚡ Lower Power Limit (TDP)

Standard RTX 3080 (Founders & AIB models) = 320W-350W

Dell OEM RTX 3080 = Often limited to 300W or less

🔴 This means slightly lower performance in demanding workloads.

📏 Custom PCB & Cooling Design

Dell often uses a non-standard PCB layout, making it harder to swap coolers or use in non-Dell cases.

The cooling solution is usually weaker than AIB (ASUS, MSI, etc.) models.

🖥️ BIOS & Compatibility Issues

Some Dell GPUs only work on Dell motherboards due to custom BIOS restrictions.

May lack full power adjustments or undervolting options in MSI Afterburner.

🎛️ Fewer Ports & Features

Some Dell RTX 3080 models have fewer DisplayPort/HDMI outputs than standard versions.

❌ Potential Downsides
Slightly lower performance due to power limits.

Weaker cooling compared to aftermarket brands.

Possible BIOS restrictions.

Less resale value (since it’s an OEM part).

✅ When It’s Worth Buying
If it’s significantly cheaper than a standard RTX 3080.

If you have an Alienware/Dell system, where compatibility won’t be an issue.

🏆 Verdict: Should You Get It?
🔴 Only buy if it’s way cheaper than a standard RTX 3080 and you’re OK with minor performance loss.
💡 Otherwise, a retail RTX 3080 (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, EVGA, etc.) is a safer choice with better cooling, resale value, and overclocking ability.

Do you have a specific listing I should analyze for you? 🚀

What's different aboutv2 and turbo in NEW VIDEO CARD ASUS Turbo GeForce RTX 3080 V2 10GB GDDR6X TURBO-RTX3080-10G-V2
ChatGPT said:
The ASUS Turbo GeForce RTX 3080 V2 is a blower-style GPU, and it differs from standard RTX 3080 models in several key ways. Here's what you need to know:

Key Differences Between ASUS Turbo RTX 3080 V2 & Standard 3080 Models
Feature	ASUS Turbo RTX 3080 V2	Standard RTX 3080 (Triple-Fan AIB Models)
Cooling	Blower-style single-fan	Triple-fan open-air design
Size	Slimmer 2-slot design	Bulkier 2.5-3 slot design
Thermals	Hotter under load	Better cooling, lower temps
Noise	Louder (high-RPM fan)	Quieter (larger fans, lower RPMs)
Use Case	Ideal for small cases or multi-GPU setups	Better for general gaming & content creation
Airflow	Pushes hot air out of the case	Dumps hot air inside the case
Performance	Slightly lower clocks due to thermal limits	Higher boost clocks, better sustained performance
What is "V2"?
The V2 version of the ASUS Turbo RTX 3080 was released to comply with new NVIDIA power regulations.

V2 models remove NVLink (SLI support)

May have slight firmware & cooling tweaks

Otherwise, same as the original ASUS Turbo RTX 3080

Who Should Buy the ASUS Turbo RTX 3080 V2?
✅ Best for:

Small form factor (SFF) builds where triple-fan GPUs won’t fit.

Workstations that need multiple GPUs (blower cards exhaust hot air out of the case).

Rack-mounted systems where space and airflow are critical.

🚫 Not ideal for:

Gaming & general PC use (runs hotter & louder than triple-fan models).

Standard desktop cases with good airflow (triple-fan models are much better).

🏆 Verdict: Should You Buy It?
If you're building a compact workstation or need multi-GPU support, yes—blower cards are ideal for these setups.

If you want better thermals, lower noise, and sustained performance, get a standard triple-fan RTX 3080 instead.

Would you like me to check if it's in stock or compare prices for you? 🚀

❌ No cooling advantage if using a well-ventilated case (like your Fractal Silent case).

🏆 Verdict: Should You Use It in Your Build?
No—unless you have airflow constraints.

Since your build prioritizes silence and stability, a triple-fan RTX 3080 or 4070 Ti would be a better fit.

Blower cards are only useful in small cases or multi-GPU setups—you don’t need those benefits.

The extra heat & noise will reduce the quality of life in your editing workflow.

🔹 Better Alternatives for Your Build:

RTX 3080 (Standard Triple-Fan) → Same power, much better cooling & noise levels.

RTX 4070 Ti → Faster & more power-efficient than the 3080.

RTX 4070 Super → More modern option, better cooling, AV1 encoding.

I use HitFilm. What's the difference between HitFilm and Premiere as far as performance is considered?
ChatGPT said:
HitFilm vs. Premiere Pro: Performance Comparison for Video Editing
Since you're using HitFilm Express, it's important to understand how its performance needs differ from Adobe Premiere Pro. While both are powerful video editing software, they utilize hardware differently, meaning the best GPU for Premiere Pro might not be the best for HitFilm.

1️⃣ GPU Usage
🏆 Premiere Pro
GPU-accelerated effects with CUDA (NVIDIA) or OpenCL (AMD)

Uses NVENC (NVIDIA’s hardware encoder) for faster H.264/H.265 exports

More dependent on CPU than GPU for timeline scrubbing

🎬 HitFilm
Heavily GPU-reliant for effects, compositing, and real-time playback

Uses OpenGL rendering, making GPU choice even more important

Loves high VRAM for multi-layered effects & composites

👉 What This Means:
For Premiere Pro, a strong CPU with a mid-range GPU (e.g., RTX 4070) works well.
For HitFilm, the GPU matters more, so getting a high-VRAM GPU like the RTX 3090 (24GB) or RTX 4070 Ti (16GB) can greatly improve performance.

2️⃣ Timeline Scrubbing & Real-Time Playback
Premiere Pro
Scrubbing is CPU-bound; more cores = smoother scrubbing

Can use proxies for smoother performance

Effects and transitions are GPU-accelerated but some rely on CPU

HitFilm
Way more GPU-reliant than Premiere

Complex VFX-heavy timelines demand high VRAM and fast memory bandwidth

If GPU is weak, playback will stutter badly

👉 What This Means:
For HitFilm, a stronger GPU (RTX 3090 / 3080 12GB / 4070 Ti) is more important than a cutting-edge CPU.

3️⃣ Rendering & Export Speeds
Premiere Pro
Uses GPU for rendering & exporting (H.264/H.265)

NVENC (NVIDIA GPUs) speeds up export times massively

AMD GPUs are not as efficient due to lack of NVENC

HitFilm
Also uses GPU for rendering, but less efficient than Premiere

NVENC not as optimized as in Premiere

Effects-heavy renders can slow down exports if GPU is weak

👉 What This Means:
If you're rendering a lot, NVENC (NVIDIA) will speed up exports in both programs, but HitFilm doesn’t use it as well as Premiere.

4️⃣ VRAM & Effects Performance
Premiere Pro
Doesn’t need massive VRAM unless using high-res RAW footage

8-12GB VRAM is fine for 4K editing

HitFilm
Loves high VRAM for effects-heavy edits

VFX-heavy projects (particles, color grading, 3D layers) benefit from 16GB+ VRAM

8GB VRAM can cause slowdowns

👉 What This Means:
For HitFilm, RTX 3080 12GB, RTX 4070 Ti 16GB, or RTX 3090 (24GB) are better choices than lower-VRAM GPUs like the RTX 4060 Ti (8GB).

🚀 Best GPU for HitFilm (Performance per $)
💎 Best Overall: RTX 4070 Ti (16GB) – High performance, lower price than 3090.

🔥 Best Budget: RTX 3080 12GB – Good balance of price & VRAM.

⚡ Best High-End: RTX 3090 (24GB) – Future-proof, best for complex VFX projects.

🎯 Final Recommendation for You
If you mostly edit basic 4K videos with light effects, RTX 4070 (12GB) or RTX 3080 (12GB) is plenty.

If you heavily use VFX, color grading, and composites, RTX 4070 Ti (16GB) or RTX 3090 (24GB) will significantly improve playback & rendering.

If you're on a budget, RTX 3060 Ti (8GB) or RTX 4060 Ti (16GB) is acceptable, but HitFilm benefits more from high VRAM.

Would you like me to check for in-stock options at the best price? 🚀

✅ More Quiet Under Load – A larger radiator means fans don’t have to spin as fast, reducing noise at high workloads.
✅ More Future-Proofing – If you upgrade to a higher-end CPU later (like i9-14900K), the 360mm will be ready.

⚠️ When the Castle 240EX Might Be OK
If you have case space limitations and can't fit a 360mm radiator.

If you prioritize slightly better pump quality (DeepCool’s pump design is generally more refined).

If you’re not planning to overclock, and noise is your #1 concern.

🔥 Final Verdict
✔ MONTECH HYPERFLOW ARGB360 = Best for long video editing sessions, high heat, and CPU-intensive tasks.
✔ DeepCool Castle 240EX = Acceptable if space is a concern, but will run hotter under load.

✔ Mount the RTX 3090 Hybrid's 120/240mm rad in the rear or top
✔ Mount the MONTECH 360mm in the front (but check GPU clearance!)
⚠ Potential Issue: If the RTX 3090 is long, it may conflict with the front 360mm AIO.

🔹 Option 2: 240mm CPU AIO + GPU Hybrid (Most Compatible)
✔ Mount the RTX 3090 Hybrid rad in the rear (120mm) or top (240mm, if possible)
✔ Use a 240mm CPU AIO (like Castle 240EX) in the top
✔ No clearance issues!

🔥 Final Verdict
✅ If GPU fits with 360mm front AIO → Go MONTECH 360mm + GPU rear mount.

✅ If GPU is too long → Go Castle 240EX top + GPU AIO in rear.

⚠ Make sure your case has space for the hybrid GPU’s radiator before finalizing! 🚀

👉 Confirm your specific RTX 3090 Hybrid model’s radiator size & let me know if you need help with clearance measurements!

You said:
Willi it conflict with front mount
ChatGPT said:
Yes, the RTX 3090 Hybrid’s radiator could conflict with a front-mounted 360mm AIO in the Fractal Design Pop XL Silent, depending on the GPU length and how much clearance remains after mounting the front radiator.

🔍 Potential Issues with Front-Mounted 360mm AIO & RTX 3090 Hybrid
GPU Length vs. Radiator Thickness

The Fractal Pop XL Silent supports up to 380mm GPU length without a front radiator.

With a front-mounted 360mm radiator + fans (~55-60mm thick total), GPU clearance is reduced to around 320-330mm.

Many RTX 3090 Hybrid cards are around 313-340mm in length, so it could be very tight or impossible.

Hybrid GPU AIO Placement

Most RTX 3090 Hybrid models have a 120mm or 240mm radiator.

If you mount a 360mm radiator in the front, you’ll need to place the GPU’s AIO radiator in the rear (120mm) or top (240mm max).

🚀 Best Cooling Setup to Avoid Conflicts
✅ Option 1: Safe & Compatible Setup
✔ Mount the RTX 3090 Hybrid’s AIO radiator in the rear (120mm) or top (240mm, if supported).
✔ Use a 240mm CPU AIO (like DeepCool Castle 240EX) in the top.
✔ This ensures maximum compatibility without clearance issues.

⚠️ Option 2: Risky (Check Before Buying)
✔ Mount the 360mm CPU AIO in the front
✔ Ensure the RTX 3090 Hybrid is under ~320mm in length.
✔ Mount the GPU’s AIO radiator in the rear (120mm) or top (if 240mm supported).
⚠ If the GPU is too long, it won’t fit with a front-mounted 360mm radiator.

🔥 Final Verdict
✅ Best bet: Use a 240mm CPU AIO + Mount the GPU AIO in the rear or top.

⚠ If using a 360mm front AIO, check GPU clearance first!

Your export times will be nearly identical unless the render is extremely GPU-bound.

Noticeable?

No. Same speed, same quality.

4. GPU-Accelerated Effects & Color Grading
4070 Ti: Has more CUDA cores, which can accelerate complex GPU-based effects faster.

4070 Super: Slightly slower, but not enough to be obvious in casual editing.

Noticeable?

Maybe if you do heavy color grading, compositing, or Fusion work.

Otherwise, feels the same.

Summary: What You’ll Actually Feel
Task	4070 Ti Advantage?	Do You Feel It?
Basic 4K editing	No	Feels identical
Multi-layer projects with GPU effects	Slight	Barely noticeable
Timeline scrubbing on unrendered 4K	Slight	Minor delay on 4070 Super
Exporting with NVENC	No	No difference
8K editing or heavy Fusion work	Yes	Noticeable speed difference
Verdict for You
If you're editing standard 4K footage with some effects and not doing Fusion or extreme color grading,
you’ll barely notice a difference.
Go 4070 Super and save money unless you know your workload pushes into higher-end territory.

Let me know your average timeline complexity and I can give a more tailored call.

For gaming?
ChatGPT said:
For gaming, the Radeon RX 5700 also vastly outperforms the GTX 1050 Ti.

Gaming Performance Comparison:
Metric	RX 5700	GTX 1050 Ti
Architecture	RDNA (7nm)	Pascal (14nm)
VRAM	8GB GDDR6	4GB GDDR5
1080p Gaming	Ultra settings, 100+ FPS (avg)	Medium settings, 30–60 FPS
1440p Gaming	High/Ultra settings, 60–90 FPS	Low-Medium, <30 FPS (many games)
4K Gaming	Medium settings, 30–60 FPS	Not recommended
Ray Tracing	Not supported	Not supported
Driver Support (2024)	Still decent	Very limited
Summary:
RX 5700 can handle modern AAA games at high to ultra settings at 1080p and 1440p with great frame rates.

GTX 1050 Ti is now only good for esports or older/lighter titles at low to medium settings.

The RX 5700 delivers about 3–4x the gaming performance of the 1050 Ti, making it far better for any modern gaming workload.
