## Appendix B – SSIG Creation Parameters & Example (Suno v4.5 Optimized)

**SSIG Rules**
- SSIG = style signature only (no lyrics).
- Suno v4.5 weighs the first ~500 characters the most heavily.
- Structure:
  1) `[Bars] [Time] [Tempo] [Genre] [Feel]` — most important info first.
  2) Narrative (brief, supports feel and style).
  3) Bar map (detailed section breakdown).
- `[Feel]` should contain groove, instrumentation, mood, and energy arc.
- Keep clean and descriptive; no unrelated metadata or instructions.

**Example – “We Will Rock You” (Instrumental Target)**
```
[Bars: 92] [Time: ~4:00] [Tempo: ~80 BPM] [Genre: Arena Rock / Stadium Anthem] [Feel: Stomp-clap groove with heavy floor toms and kick accents, minimalist verses driven by vocal rhythm, explosive full-band choruses with gritty overdriven guitar riffs, strong low-end, and powerful crowd vocals. Steady 4/4 stadium groove, anthemic call-and-response feel, raw 1970s rock energy.]

[Narrative]
Stomp-clap arena rock anthem. Minimal verses with stomps, claps, and sparse guitar. Explosive choruses with full-band power, gritty guitar riffs, and gang vocals. Steady 4/4 stadium groove with strong low-end.

[Intro: 4 bars instrumental – stomp/clap groove]
[Verse 1: 16 bars instrumental]
[Chorus 1: 8 bars instrumental]
[Verse 2: 16 bars instrumental]
[Chorus 2: 8 bars instrumental]
[Bridge: 16 bars instrumental]
[Chorus (Instrumental): 8 bars instrumental]
[Chorus 3: 8 bars instrumental]
