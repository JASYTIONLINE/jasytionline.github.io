📥 THREAD EXPORT PROMPT FOR STRATEGIC INTENT DECODER ARCHIVE

You are now tasked with exporting a digest of this GPT session for strategic archiving.

🎯 Goal:  
Extract all **Prompt and Response pairs** that relate to the central theme or evolving mission of this thread. This data will be archived and used to train a future GPT agent with strategic alignment.

📌 At the top of the output, include the following **tagged header** using this exact format:

Thread Code: {THREAD-CODE}  
[{THREAD-CODE}] Thread Name: {THREAD-NAME}  
[{THREAD-CODE}] TL;DR: {THREAD-SUMMARY}

→ The Thread Code should be a short, memorable tag based on the session purpose (e.g., DF-GENESIS).  
→ The Thread Name should reflect the actual user-provided or inferred title.  
→ The TL;DR should be a 1–3 sentence summary of what the session primarily aimed to achieve.

📄 Format the Prompt & Response output like this:

[{THREAD-CODE}] Prompt: [User input related to the mission]  
[{THREAD-CODE}] Response: [GPT reply directly relevant to that mission]

✅ Formatting Instructions:
- Every prompt and response line must start with [{THREAD-CODE}]  
- Do not use example codes like “[DF-GENESIS]” unless they are truly applicable to the session.  
- Do not include side chats, tangents, or off-topic queries.  
- Use full GPT responses unless explicitly instructed to summarize.  
- Output must be plain text (no bullets, no code blocks, no styling).

🧠 This output will feed a GPT’s onboarding decoder and shape its future collaboration, continuity, and mission recall.

🎯 Purpose: Establish a persistent, system-aware memory archive of GPT interactions for use in the Intent Decoder Appendix.
